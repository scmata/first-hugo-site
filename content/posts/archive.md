This is an Archive of some random parts of the website which I liked a bit but don't really have a place to put right now.

# Section of old "About" page:


## Goals:
* Creating a sustainable, **happier and more equal** society
* Creating a strong, stable **community** around me that lifts each other up
* Finding a **career** where I can work on projects I find **interesting intellectually**
* Use and develop my **leadership** skills to help reach my goals
* Live each day **mindfully**

## The idea of this website:
* To **"show my work"** or sell myself
* **Inspire a culture** of "showing your work" in Oxford
* Act as a point of **outreach and inspiration** to show how people like me can be successful

## I have a wide range of skills. Here are some highlights:
* **Leadership**: I have led a **sports team** in my college in Oxford and competition teams in my secondary school
* **Independent thinking**: From a young age I have been motivated to lead **my own path**. This has led me down many rabbit holes.
* **Public speaking**: I have **chaired lectures, led Q&As and held technical presentations.** I enjoy the opportunity to present.
* **Problem solving**: I have worked on a **variety of projects** and I enjoy working on **intellectually stimulating** material (and also find repetitive/simple tasks sometimes mundane!)
* **Empathy**: I connect well with other people. It is underrated how far being a **good listener** and a centred, well-mannered person will get you. Being from a **very diverse background** and having many personal interests also helps.
* **Time management**: I juggle *a lot* of things in my life. Especially in Oxford, **I am very busy**. I have learnt to create **systems** to sustain this
