## How I approach gaining the second half of my education

I think during university it is important to consider what you will actually learn from it. Some degrees are vocational, while others are academic. Nevertheless, you probably won't apply many of the hard skills you learn exactly from you university degree in your future job. However, it is still important to do well because you don't know exactly which skills might come in useful in the future, as an engineer being able to know about structural analysis to circuits can be very useful depending on the project.

However, there are many soft skills you learn in university which may or may not be on your curriculum. Things such as leadership, communication, teamwork, public speaking and more. One of the ways that private schools have an advantage is that they go beyond the government curriculum and emphasise teaching students core life skills like these from an early age. Take public speaking as an example, many state schools do not have as large an emphasis on it as much as private schools. They get so good at it that they could sustain lively discussion with a wall. Also, for people who know others in the system, they will know the systems and strategies to succeed. Hence, publiciing them is good. As an international student or recent immiggrant, even learning the systems that you are meant to succeed in will take some time. 

Here are some things to focus on and take advantage of if you're early in your university career.


Learn how to learn
This is maybe one of the best things you can do. I know people at Oxford University who spent 3 years improving their study habits, focusing on ineffective methods. If they had focus on refining their study techniques at the beginning of their journey, they could have saved days of stress balancing their academic and extra curricular life while trying to get good grades. If there's one thing you do before starting university, learning how to learn would be one of the most useful. Especially because for many people the stlye of learning is a step up because it is so much more independent. In first year in the UK, exams don't count for much if at all, so I would focus on trying a bunch of different styles of learning and revision and seeing what works for you. Importantly, you also need to be good at using feedback to improve your methods.

Learn to learn the content. Learn to pass the exam.

Generally the ability to focus and block of time to allow that.
And to channel that energy into effective study strategies. 

Career

Most people go to university in hopes of finding a well paying job at the end. Get familiar with your universities' career service early and what help they can offer. Make especially good use of 1 on 1 appointments since these can be one of the best ways to get advice from somebody who knows what they're talking about. In my experience, they are best for asking specific questions. Such as "is this CV good? how can I improve it". Harder/more open-ended questions are much more difficult to answer for everyone.

Things that are harder for a career center to help you with are finding the places to apply to. When I was applying to jobs as a teenager, most places advertised on Indeed. However, most of your applications will actually come through finding specific company websites and applying directly. 

To help search I would use platforms like google, gradcracker and linkedin. Look at where alumni from your university/other uniervisities have gone.  Search up [job field] + [location you want work]. Also talk to people who are working these jobs, and they can suggest places you can apply for, and potentially give you opinions on what the work culture is like at different places.

For a three year degree, the general timeline is to get an internship after your second year and to try and convert that into a full-time offer. If that doesn't work out, you can also apply for graduate roles in your third year. 

For a four year degree, the timeline is similar but you can do an internship after your second and third year. Some roles will say you have to be in your penultimate year of university, in this case just say you were planning to graduate with a bachelor's degree. It's very common to do this.

Another option are year in industries. These have different benefits/tradeoffs.

What about first year internships? I would say that this is possible, but it can be difficult to have the experience to be useful to be working in some roles (especially in a technical field) only after a year of education. For most internships, you will not be productive to the company straightaway since you need to learn how the team works/what your role entails. This is more true the less experience you have. However, for thee opportunities it is best to reach out to people directly/contact small companies. These are less likely to have formal application procedures so will make your life much simpler.

Notice that it can be difficult to try out different options if you are split between a couple career paths. At best you have 2 internships in different fields. Advice for these situations is a different article though...

Also learn how to network! Genreally after your first job, your next one will come from referals not through applying through application portals.

Learn how to learn/networking

I also touch on this in this article. Where I disucss the different types of learning. You want to get good at both independent learning, as well as learning from other people, and seeking out conversations with people to learn about things you don't know about. This is a major life skills, knowing where to find and having the confidence to ask people for information and advice. It's also something that studying just for grades will make it hard to achieve.

Social life
University is often a time where people make some of their lifelong friendships. It also provides a safe place in general to experiment and settle into your identity. Doing this around peers around the same age with roughly the same goals is an amazing opportunity. Make the most of it to try new things! You will learn a lot about finding friends, romantic relationships. Also it is an opportunity to learn how to organise people and create communities while you are a student. Do not take this for granted (John Fish).


Extra curriculars
Sports and arts.

This is one of the things that might be most new to you. Extra curriculars can be a big opporutunity in the UK. You will be surrounded by many people the same age who want to do *stuff*. Generally, if you can think of it there's probably a society for it. If not, there would probably be at least a few people interested if you created the society, which would also be a great learning experience.

I would say it is a good idea to try many different societies when you first join university to explore your interests and maybe find new ones. This is also a good opportunity to meet people from other years. Generally, if you are on a three year degree people will have their largest leadership roles in societies in their second year, so starting quickly is a good idea. For people on four year degrees typically timing is more spreadout, with presidents of societies in second, third and fourth year generally.
