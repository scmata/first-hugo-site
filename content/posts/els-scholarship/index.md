**Future leaders in engineering are not simply born**—they are shaped by opportunities like the Engineering Leadership Scholarship (ELS) scholarship offered by the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng). This scheme
takes ambitious students like you and me and provides resources to **accelerate your personal development**. While you need to demonstrate passion for engineering (and to be studying towards it <ins>or a related discipline</ins>), **they simply want you to make the biggest impact you can**  and **pivoting is ok** in the end. **Engineering is calling for its next role models**, and I invite you to **join me** in taking the journey to become one.

Firstly, the ELS community is **unique**. Even while studying at the University of Oxford, I found myself 
feeling... my peers could be more ambitious. Engineers at Oxford are not typically known for being very social, so even those motivated to build impactful careers often **lacked spaces to share and nurture their ambitions** (most students were even scared to ask questions in lectures, and our demanding schedule does not help). However, I felt the difference in the ELS community immediately upon meeting the other scholars at the annual ELS alumni networking event. **People there are magnets in their communities**, and are eager to share their insights and to lift each other up. Just being surrounded by such **openly passionate and driven people** reassured me that I’m not alone in my dreams.

Furthermore, they offer **£5000** solely for your personal development. This is a great resource that has given me opportunities to attend conferences, purchase learning materials and **fund my year abroad experience in Princeton**. As long as you can tie it into your mission, they are lenient with how you use the money too. To make best use of this money one of the first resources you'll create is your **personal development plan** - a 10 year projection of your future pathway. While planning so far into the future is hard, it is useful to learn about your potential next steps and you will receive support to **achieve your goals as quickly as possible**. 

You will even **learn about yourself through the application process.** Personally, I enjoyed learning about the RAEng's key challenges in building a global sustainable society and inclusive economy. I found it fulfilling to explain why these issues motivated me to become an engineer and why I want to be a leader in the field, as these are ideas I have not had the opportunity to discuss in depth before. I left my interview feeling inspired after my interviewers really wanted to understand my interests and asked great questions. In fact, **I still recall the advice I received** to always remember why I chose engineering and let that serve as my 'North Star' to guide my passion.  Furthermore, you'll have the chance to **associate your name with the prestigious Royal Academy of Engineering** and to have a professional development mentor.

Hopefully, you're convinced by now - if not, what’s holding you back? **The only real way to gain anything in life is to step out of your comfort zone and go for it.** Even if you don’t succeed on your first try, I know others who were initially rejected but went on to receive the award on their second attempt. In the most recent 2023-24 cycle, the success rate was 23%, which I’d say is a solid chance to transform your life. **Why not go for it?**
