As a caveat: I really do mean that this advice is for people who are exactly like me! So please don’t take my word for things—lots won’t apply to you because we’re different. As with all advice: think about it, see what resonates with you, consider reversing it, and generally take it as one of many data points.

[reversing advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/)

most advice is bad

try imagine the advice from the opposite person. also imagine what it would sound like for different people

We get a lot of advice from lots of different sources. How do we filter it?

Relevance
- age, industry etc.
- the more niche the better (this is instinctive)

always learn

true wealth comes from owning something
-that poem I read
income vs wealth inequality

RL reward signals

most good advice is simple but hard to implement. also try reversing it.
some advice or skills you can spend a lifetime trying to figure out e.g. good sports technique like kuzushi, cus it can work in many different environments



Read the best books first (at the right level). It's important to have the mentality of an olympian (stanford business school last lectures), it's easier to have high goals. But sometimes advice depends on where you are at. Example: company scaling. Scaling a company from 0 to 1 million per year is completely different from 1 to 100 million a year.

Do I want to be like this person? Or which part of me wants to be like this person?

You wouldn't listen to an overweight person on how to get abs, unless they've done it before. You wouldn't listen to a broke person on how to start a business.
watch our for signalling

Think about why they are giving you the advice

Try and figure out the unknown unknowns - what are they not telling you (often it's their background or their small advnatages)


Get diverse/contrasting opinions. listen to bad advice, because that person is probably trying to tell you the right thing.

- i dont typically do something/commit to something unless i can belive it with my own conceptual/generative model of the world instead of following what advice or most people tell me. typically tho, somettimes my model si incorrect or doesnt have enough info. in that case i seek more info by exploration with actions myself or asking someone, o rjust choose a random action (which includes no action) in the scheme of forced choice


levels of embodiement of advice
-reading it
-watching a video of it
- seeing someone do it
-doing it yourself



6 principles of influence/pyschology of consumption

social liking

how we consume things/are influenced. all of our feelings and emotion can be categorised into one of these six things
-scarcity (Michael reeves, aura)
-consistency (can still upload every year but be scarce)
-reciprocity
-consensus (if it has a million likes it's easier to watch)
-similarity (can't repeat the formula, have to innovate on it with context). have text on screen have your face in first frame. if you follow every thing in rulebook people won't care because it's already been done
-authority (effort can also help with this -because it shows it's worth listening to)

also success framework for sticky ideas



Imagine 

work hard to set yourself up in life/ enjoy university while it lasts, it's the best time of your life

should/want
