understand what shaped their culture and your culture

or looking for role models

three things
- they are great
-they've studied great people and pass on the knowledge
- i forgot the third lol

either incremental or aspirational

As a caveat: I really do mean that this advice is for people who are exactly like me! So please don’t take my word for things—lots won’t apply to you because we’re different. As with all advice: think about it, see what resonates with you, consider reversing it, and generally take it as one of many data points.

[reversing advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/)

most advice is bad

try imagine the advice from the opposite person. also imagine what it would sound like for different people

We get a lot of advice from lots of different sources. How do we filter it?

Can't do perspective advice sometimes e.g. realtionships, old people

there is no "one trick" instagram thing
toxic productivity

something you might have forgotten

Relevance
- age, industry etc.
- the more niche the better (this is instinctive)

always learn

true wealth comes from owning something
-that poem I read
income vs wealth inequality

RL reward signals

most good advice is simple but hard to implement. also try reversing it.
some advice or skills you can spend a lifetime trying to figure out e.g. good sports technique like kuzushi, cus it can work in many different environments



Read the best books first (at the right level). It's important to have the mentality of an olympian (stanford business school last lectures), it's easier to have high goals. But sometimes advice depends on where you are at. Example: company scaling. Scaling a company from 0 to 1 million per year is completely different from 1 to 100 million a year.

Do I want to be like this person? Or which part of me wants to be like this person?

You wouldn't listen to an overweight person on how to get abs, unless they've done it before. You wouldn't listen to a broke person on how to start a business.


or person learning languages or knowing how to learn (e.g. Archer Newton)

if people see you aren't implementing your lessons, they'll smell cap.

watch our for signalling

Think about why they are giving you the advice

Try and figure out the unknown unknowns - what are they not telling you (often it's their background or their small advnatages)


Get diverse/contrasting opinions. listen to bad advice, because that person is probably trying to tell you the right thing.

- i dont typically do something/commit to something unless i can belive it with my own conceptual/generative model of the world instead of following what advice or most people tell me. typically tho, somettimes my model si incorrect or doesnt have enough info. in that case i seek more info by exploration with actions myself or asking someone, o rjust choose a random action (which includes no action) in the scheme of forced choice


levels of embodiement of advice
-reading it
-watching a video of it
- seeing someone do it
-doing it yourself



6 principles of influence/pyschology of consumption

social liking

how we consume things/are influenced. all of our feelings and emotion can be categorised into one of these six things
-scarcity (Michael reeves, aura)
-consistency (can still upload every year but be scarce)
-reciprocity
-consensus (if it has a million likes it's easier to watch)
-similarity (can't repeat the formula, have to innovate on it with context). have text on screen have your face in first frame. if you follow every thing in rulebook people won't care because it's already been done
-authority (effort can also help with this -because it shows it's worth listening to)

also success framework for sticky ideas



Imagine 

work hard to set yourself up in life/ enjoy university while it lasts, it's the best time of your life

should/want

reverse the advice


The value of microinfluencers?

microlearning app

wisdom, case studies


advice from people and books > advice from YT > advice from instagram

if I can better capitalise my time focusing on those two, I shouldn't spend extra time watching YT videos

I have some business ideas, need to watch the videos once I encounter some problems and need to scale. Don't need to watch a bunch of case studies anymore rn e.g. starter story, or how to learn to code more robust stuff as a beginner developer.

need to get started and need to make mistakes.


"Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good
answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future."

we get most of the knowledge to have the contrarin view through experience and knowledge ig of the world, through experiencing problems too.

uses for AI
-giving you more context while reading e.g. defintions, backgrund histru

stories are the best way of illuminating principles e.g. newsppaer story

how do we make sure the story is based on truth though?

certifiation by a university? channel views or course/website recommendations? results?

Bays rule

useful not true derek sivers:

- all advice is based on summaries, which require a perspective

Hume's problem of induction

Our prior about most things about human organisations and how to navigate them are very fuzzy, because organisations change so much through space (cities and countries)  and time (the past and future).

Only exception is when you can tell your situation is very similar (hint: it's probably not, although you can try figure out what you have in common)

reason from first principles

mentor advice

you don't really understand someone's advice until you could predict it yourself


seek stuff you don't understand cus it's more informative, then work to understand it

- 27 Conflicting Answers on How to Live
Sivers notes that he wrote Useful, Not True as the prequel to How to Live. I believe that Sivers wants us to read How to Live knowing that nothing in the book is true. Everything in the book that resonates with you is just a belief – your belief. There are no right or wrong answers. Your goal is to read the book and choose what is useful to you at this moment in time.

some principles apply  to most people (e.g. value relationships)


some principles you have to ignore if you don't want to be at the top of the bell curve (to be like 99.9% of people you can't act like 99% of people)

some principels apply to your background in general


e.g. work hard (but not too hard)


how you live your lifeis a combination of inertia and reflection and pivoting/widsom


derek sivers quote on life being a summation of your habits and days from 27 book

"Goals don't improve your future. Goals only improve your present actions"

When to trust advice? Consensus from a variety of sources. quote about madness of the crowd though?

“Madness is rare in individuals — but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs, it is the rule.”

That’s from Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil (1886).

Find your collective madness?


the wisdom intelligence curve with a spike


bayesian approach to wisdom
- have very diverse experiences
- simon dedeo thinking almost

but it aonly makes sense if you really try something gan, experience, then mentors can help you pivot and rediect a bit

you can't learn life lessons just by reading. also you forget most things pretty quickly

and there's no point having a list of 50 principles or something, because you can't keep all of those in your head at the same time.

therefore, you must iterate by trying something, 

then the best thing you can do is to steer your habits and daily life, because that is what makes up your life, no high level advice will solve that


taekwondo didn't teach me principles by telling me them, i learnt through practice

the same with athletics

practice doesnt make perfect, perfect practice does

life as close to your principles as possible, then you can actually understand them (or reflect on how well you meet them)

same 


all old people aren't wise, make an old person young again and they would also probably make mistakes, just different ones, 

-especially since the world is different to how they grew up

-especially if you didn't just change their age, imagine making them into a different body with different emotional tendencies etc

there is no universal advice that works for everyone, religion is the closest thing we have

but they do know general principles of "how not to be stupid"

there is no magic answer

also 


there are principles that generally work though


and reinforcing those through reading good works is useful


avoiding being just happy and smart, also need to be useful, which you also learn from

-> https://sive.rs/hsu

- people who read too much self-help/perspective on the world

- but not all of these people will actually be useful

(ideas dont belong in your head)

also a small tendency to be scientists and philosophers


MMM on hubermn (he has the advice and actually applies it)


we are far from good studies of this (e.g. happiness studies from 2010)

derek sivers on mentors too


dont make stupid mistakes of the crowd

choose your madness (everyone wants to be made in some way)




thoughts on entrepreneurship

- different skillsets 

eg. first 10 employees create the thing of value

easy to create value, but you need enough value that people recognise it is valuable and will pay for it



memory is unreliable, e.g. asking people what made them happy
