Game theory in squid game.

It is interesting because it seems lots of similar concepts carry over to help describe the games. Also because the rules of the game are often broader than the inital explanations suggest, so as players figure this out their strategies evolve.

lots of strategies like signalling, imperfect information, double cross and communication.

One of the most interesting points for me though was, is that the structure of a game can help incentivise people's actions in a game (for example if they all optimise for their individual gain). 

Themes:
- Western vs korean story telling. Happy ending (squid games overthrown and guy gets to see his son) or sad ending - most people die and the games keep going. Which one is right?
- Are people inherently good
- Does the world tend towards the happy ending

A central question is if people are inherently good?[^being_good]

Game theory is how to strategise around other rational decision makers.

Life can be thought of as a game. We have different rules and punishments. Like tax, jail and how we vote in government. Generally this seems to me to optimise two things 1. "The size of the pie" to increase wealth for everyone 2. To guarantee everyone basic human rights 3. To make society somewhat far and equal, or in another abstract sense "good" for evertone.

So while we can think about ethics on the individual scale, what squid game shows us is that our ethics do not exist in a bubble. How other's treat us is that the prescence of other people affect the realistic or rational strategies presented to us. Both on an individual level and a global level.

On an individual level, most simple case is prisoners dilemma, since the rational case is to both defect, unless you both have enough trust to choose the optimal outcome.

Through principles such as trust we can improve our outcomes.

And this not only applies on the individual level, but the global level too. A big theme at the center of squid game is the fact that the way our society is set up allowed these games to happen. People are allowed to reach such low levels of livelihood and debt that they're able to be exploited by the extremely wealthy elite.

The key questions is that are we able to change the rules, incentivse and structure of society to make the world more fair? As well as reasonabbly understanding what outcomes our current system leads to if people played it like a game, because we might not like the answer.

One perspective is to think about how we can construct society where the question of whether people are good or not doesn't matter. One where making the best decision for yourself leads to a good outcome for everyone. Is such as reality possible? I hope so.


People play life like a game, and everyone is trying to "win". However, we can change the rules of the game so that everyone trying to win can benefit the world. Or we can have rules that allow a minority to win.

One key example is in wealth and political power,
Note that people on each side will want to have differing opinions. E.g. the wealthy will want to create a structure to ensure they can remain powerful. The working class will want to increase equality, but not at the expense of ruining the economy e.g. complete anarchism wouldn't work. So some sense of structure helps society, but how should it be done? We're probably still a bit of a way from the ideal solution, but capitalism and democracy seem to be our baseline right now.

The interesting thing is is that the elite want to have a decent standard of life for the working class, otherwise if they start suffering too much they will have a revolution, like the french revolution. Once a system is in place too it is hard to change, or when people are afriad (belling the cat-good desctiption in dixit). Shocks to the system can help allow change too.e.g. french revolution

One can find many ways of trying to answer the question if people are inherently good. 

if people were still young before they died, we would probably have more backstabbing.





Regardless of individual countries, I think thw power of some transnational corporations explotiing the power of the network effect over the whole globe is too high. 



Other interesting aspects of game theory
-Negotiation
-Auctions
-War
-Politics
-One interesting thing for me would be to understand how games around us [affect inequality](https://chatgpt.com/share/686f5efc-4dc8-8003-b99d-dfd18213dc49)


Cool applications




NB in economics behvaioural economics and data driven approaches are more popular now.

maybe it's too difficult to answer? why? are games too complicated? combining games with data/finding out the games from the data.

Characters have conflicted morals and backgrounds.


[^being_good]: An interesting point here is defining what good is. One concrete tradeoff is utilitanirsm and deontoligsm (values based ethics).
    When the MC has to decide whether to sacrifice himself or the child, it's a difficult decision. If he choses based on utilitanirsm he might taint his potential as a martyr and the symbolism of his revolution. However, by winning the prize money maybe he would be more equipped to end the games for good. 

    Otherwise, if he choses based on deontoligsm he will not have to change his moral code-but is it the optimal decision?
    
    (However, this is complicated because when is a sacrifice justified for the greater good? Having a good answer to this is what separates you from becoming the enemy)

    One simple answer will be is when the outcome is clear. For example, the trolley problem. Or even the knife problem. Stab one person to help 5 others live. Then it's okay to end one life potentially. But when uncertainty comes in it's harder to decide. For me it appears that utilitanirsm seems like the ultimate goal, but falling back on values seems like a safe answer when outcomes are uncertain.

    I would like to hear any arguments about this. One issues might be minority rights.

"The Evolution of Cooperation" 

Most of all, it made me comfortable with the idea that self-interest, over a long enough time horizon and expanding what you'd consider in payoffs, is often indistinguishable from altruism

Some others:

There are times you should punish (retaliate) even if you're not mad - and vice versa.

Some more from math than game theory: (1) some outcomes are categorically worse than others, so don't ever take your decisions for granted (never accept "everything happens for a reason"). (2) In most problems there usually is a way forward - the trick is making the problem tractable. And (3) when in doubt, simulate (and/or gather plenty of data).

Also if you play sport / games, there useful ones in Nalebuff and Dixit's "Thinking Strategically". Brinkmanship is useful. Knowing how often to choose between possible options based on payoffs sneaks in a lot in sport/games (serving left vs right, conditioning a response, bluffing vs folding).

Game Theory: An Introduction by Steven Tadelis is very good book. It explains the material well and walks you through classic example problems.


My second choice would be Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook by William Spaniel. This book is good in that it's concise and covers a lot of good foundation material with classic examples. He has a great YouTube channel that follows the book and has a website worth material from his Game Theory 101 book.

Eilon Solan, Michael Maschler, and Shmuel Zamir is the bible of GT, basically. But it isn't an introductory book as a 'recommendation' for a beginner, very mathematics heavy from the start and includes normed-spaces etc. But, if you understand that book cover-to-cover you will know everything you need to know to start research/reading research papers - so that is 'the one book'. This is really only accessible if you've studied some more advanced proof-based mathematics/physics/economics.

proof based game theory like to prove a nash equilibrium always exists and stuff

lol proving P=NP won't actually creating any algorithms, but it will help add better research direction i guess

Other

f you are looking for a fun easy read, you can try "Who Gets What And Why" by Alvin Roth (game theorist and Nobel laureate). If you want something more philosophical, try any book by Ken Binmore.

also perspective of religion/political system incentivising proper behaviour in society

not everyone has time to think about their rule for life e.g. what commandments they want to live by

also not everyone has time to think about what economic policy would be best, they just have values
and they need a way of checking/enforcing/incentivising politicians to not be corrupt or scam and hel actually thry carry out those values o the best of their ability
