# Weekend with issa

Last weekend I went to Beijing to visit Issa, a good friend I met at Princeton. Issa is a great guy, and we went into some great conversation that helped me learn way more about him as well as myself. Here are some of the things I want to share.


## Step 1: Reaching out

After our first dinner on Friday, I sent this message:

> Looking forward to tomo
> I've been reflecting on some stuff like managing friendships and navigating life decisions so it would be interesting to discuss with u too maybe.

I felt nervous sending this message. If I was visiting a general friend I didn't know well, the focus of the weekend would've been having fun and exploring. I wanted to get to know Issa on a deeper level, so even though I was nervous it was worth taking the risk. He replied:

> Yoo definitely bro let's chat abt it!
> I love that kind of stuff we'll have the day today to chat.

And boy did we chat. At a the highest level some lessons from this. Finding people who both care about their impact and value the investment to refine their direction early on.
