# Weekend with issa

Last weekend I went to Beijing to visit Issa, a good friend I met at Princeton. Issa is a great guy, and we went into some great conversation that helped me learn way more about him as well as myself. Here are some of the things I want to share.


## Step 1: Reaching out

After our first dinner on Friday, I sent this message:

> Looking forward to tomo
> I've been reflecting on some stuff like managing friendships and navigating life decisions so it would be interesting to discuss with u too maybe.

I felt nervous sending this message. If I was visiting a general friend I didn't know well, the focus of the weekend would've been having fun and exploring. I wanted to get to know Issa on a deeper level, so even though I was nervous it was worth taking the risk. He replied:

> Yoo definitely bro let's chat abt it!
> I love that kind of stuff we'll have the day today to chat.

And boy did we chat. At a the highest level some lessons from this. Finding people who both care about their impact and value the investment to refine their direction early on. 

I really related to him on this. Since I was the only person I knew who had big career goals but decided to take a gap year, although a couple other of my friends had done vaguely similar things.


Rare people who think like us.

Two reflections. Meet a lot of people to meet the good ones. Although

The more mature you are, the more quickly you can develop a deeper relationship.


## The weekend

We talked about a lot of things. While some of it is personal, I want to share some of the frameworks we discussed.

Immediately, one thing that struck me about Issa is that he seemed like a genuinely good person. Evidently from his popularity at Princeton he was very social. I enjoy making and having many connections too, but recently I had been thinking a lot about how to prioritise my most important relationships, especially as I potentially move country.

The advice he gave to me was simple:
- Prioritise yourself first.

It was simple advice but it did help me. 

Simple tradeoff, sometimes I have more time I could spend talking to people than I have spare time. So either I need to priorise or eat into my free time. My mental model, is say I have 10 hours a week to keep up with my friends. I should start from the top down. Make sure I keep with with my close friends and then 

Sometimes you feel like you should keep up with people. And also you want to give people your attention, don't want to send a message off the cuff without actually thinking about it.


## being a good person and a leader

Issa is a genuinely good person. 

Cold decision tradeoff.

## impact

the people who need the most help can't access it.

optimising for impact. 80,000 hours.

## do things that don't scale

Also looking at my history my strengrhs and weaknesses

⁃ trusting people

⁃ Being overprotective eg with family and relationships

⁃ Taking risks eg with money, hatinf losinf things. Havinf agency and being able to invest in “risky” stuff eg startups


Good ideas at the intersection of fields


Maslow principles

Then also not wvery mission or project will affect all the people it needs to evenly

And thats okay. Better than nothing


Also idea of forced choice in philossopjy,

Discount factor, explorarion vs exlpoitation, be so good they cant ignore you


Be 80% ready for next step. Dont need to be 100%. Okay to stary with bad version or fail in beginning too


The workd is built on stories

The impoetanr of learning and educating yourself



Poor people cant afford stuff like education


Roch people can afford bullshit eg easier to provide value

Or people employing people from india back home or having maids

Because of low cost of living and low general wages


Using le erage/identity eg im not from sierra leone but yh



Cultural approprtiation within the fits and stuff

Walking in someone else’s shoes


Eg high level executives






No perfect project


Also need tk learn the game to succeed in it


We need more people like bill gates!

Why im shy of camera

-dont knkw which personality to use eg code switching

Eg maybe record for my past self (or even figure self)


Going direct vs indirect hoop

Getting status and connections in consulting and phs for example


Finding role modela and inspirations

Not bad to be in a business of one-means you have a market to yourself


Business struggle to differentiate-but you have your own market

Even if you’re not from status quo that makes it more powerful


Even just seeinf ur face eg at schools


Hard to see impact

Eg lifelong friends from one soccer game with chinese and africans


Maybe one talk will help motivate someone


Motivation in and of itself is a powerful yool-if’s just not a bullet and hammer for everyone situation


But it helps

Eg wisdom


Myths

Eg workd is fair like oxford admissions vs princeton


Ozford just admits on academics, they want the smartest people




Raisinf awarmess is good too

Eg gypsies

Glib or black and white thinking


Read the best book first?

13 years old is a good time to target


Eg stratford high


Or stratford high oxbridge to get them into kes


Helping kids into private achools/ 11+


Problems might be difficult but we can take steps towards solutions!


There’s just no silver bullet fix for wverythingfff

Blog article on wealth tax and piketty and gary stevenson populist


Being selfish

Eg you die by yourself


Challenges you’re facing now for podcast

Biggest things you’ve gained from investing into eg sports


Feelinf bad about privilege


Privilege is relative


At some point you just gave to accept it and use the opportunities you have- you might not have them forwver
