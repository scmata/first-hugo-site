# Pathless path book review

A postface?

The pathless path by Paul Millard is a great book. Written by an ex-McKinsey consultant Paul challenges the expectations of the "traditional path" of work using exercepts from history as well as philosophy on work, demonstrating that the period we find ourselves is unique in the scope of history. For example, the greeks didn't see work as a goal in and of itself, but something necessary to be able to have leisure. Modern life in the West incentives us to chase more and more agains this tradition. As we know work constitutes the majority of our lives, so more than a book on life it is a book on how to live your life. This book does not pretend to have all the solutions, but it is a great first step for acknowledging there are many ways to live your life beyond what other's might think.

I agree with a majority of what Paul says. Although I do think his advice tends to apply to the average middle-high income person from the West. For example, from Paul's perspective scaling his business and managing is something he does not want to do. If everyone thought like him, society wouldn't function because teams are necessary to be able to create more than the sum of their parts. Growth is not inherently bad, but it is important to chase the right type of growth.

# The pathless path

The name of the book, the pathless path something Paul got from David Whyte, which is a paradox: "we cannot even see it is there, and we do not recognize it". Paul introduces it as an antithesis to the default path - the series of decisions and accomplishments needed to be seen as a successful adult. Everyone has a mental model of what they think others think success is, and people spend a lot of their lives sticking to these cultural scripts. However, often they are outdated. The world is changing more and more every year. Hence, more people are finding a need to define work, and life, for themselves.

#### Why we stick to the default path

Inherently, it is scary to be an individual in the crowd. John Maynard Keynes said "that it is better for reputation to succeed conventionally than to succeed unconventionally". However, Nietsche also said "madness in an individual is crazy, in crowds it is the rule". 

Why do we feel such pressure to stick to these norms?

- Signalling based economy 
- want to be loved and lovely
- it takes way more effort to think for yourself
- we apply different reasoning to ourselves and other people
- there are many paths we don't allow ourselves to consider
   e.g. need example, or permission or motivation "I don't know anyone who has done that"

Formula for life.


Arrival fallacy. Easy to extend milestones a bit than shift your paradigm about the world.

#### Disadvantages of the default path

Money doesn't buy happiness.

Chasing bad tests of prestige.
> Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to like.

World class hoop jumper (start of chapter 2)

#### WHy the pathless path is becoming less common

-People move up Maslow's pyramid to want to self acutalise more. You might feel bad if your parents sacrifice by struggling on the default path. But sometimes, you have enough. And knowing that point is important. (and not just setting a moving milestone)


# Traditional success

Paul MIllard himself has a great personal story. He was a top student but did not have pressure to make the most of it. He went to his home state school at the University of Conneticut, where he met many driven people on the honors program with "perfect SAT scores, full scholarships and five-year plans". Generally, "maximising achievements in the present to create better options in the future".

I wasn't picky about the tye of work I'd be doing, I just wanted it to be seen as impressive. He was in an environment where "maximizing potential success was one of the best things to do with your time"


Then got to McKinsey and had health crisis, where his grandfather died and he was sick wih Lyme disease. Made him question his life deciisions.
Similar to that guy at the end of the book too.

Grapple with questions
- What was I living for? (Maybe difficult to answer before the end of your life)
- What did I really want
- How did I want to look back on my life when it was my time to go?

Attachment to Paul as a successfu person/

When he was sick, he contemplated "what would people think if I couldn't work again?
identity as a high achiever

high school high achiever who cant learn how to work hard
serial hoop jumpers who don't know how to work hard



Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun 

"As I started to feel better, a different kind of energy showed up in my life. Professors Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun have suggested that many people who face crises often experience “post-traumatic growth” and that this manifests as an “appreciation for life in general, more meaningful interpersonal relationships, an increased sense of personal strength, changed priorities, and a richer existential and spiritual life."

He had internship which he didn't like using excel, because he didn't want to "spend so much time proving I was willing to do things I didn't believe in". At McKinsey he found the commitment to work is different, "people were in an endless search to do more".


Companies generally don't let us be ourselves. e.g. CEOs

#### The history of work 

Between 0AD and the 1500s, work was generally something necessary to meet basic needs or something to be skeptical of.

We see this articulated by 13th-century Catholic priest Thomas Aquinas, as he argues “labor is only necessary ‘naturali ratione’ [by natural reason] for the maintenance of individual and community.”2

In the 1940s, philosopher Erich Fromm summarized this transformation, saying, “in the Northern European countries, from the 16th century on, man developed an obsessional craving to work which had been lacking in a free man before that period.” 23 Following the Reformation, then, work as an end in itself was no longer a crazy idea. People traded one master, the Catholic Church, for another, their vocation. But along with greater freedom and self‑determination came the anxiety and insecurity of never really knowing if you were working hard enough or doing the right thing. The Church’s expectations had always provided a way to measure “goodness,” and for many, these benchmarks no longer applied

Feeling you should be working all the time


The modern version of the default path after WW2.

> No longer was it even acceptable that the child should be like his parents and live as they did; he must be better, live better, know more, dress more richly, and if possible, change from father’s trade to a profession. This dream became touchingly national." - John Steinbeck

> We made a mistake and by that, I mean my generation and my parents’ generation. The mistake we made was thinking that the period from 1946 to 1980 was the norm. No, it was not! It was the anomaly! We had just wiped out the manufacturing capabilities of anyone who could challenge us. So, the idea that you had that job with the gold watch, and you could work there for your entire career and raise a family of four and all of that, that was an anomaly.30

We focus on the job instead of the work we will do. And we imagine that the job defines our lives and we should be working all the time.


You sign up to a work culture. Although the real satisfaction is usually not having a fun job. page 65 ish

"Seeing the job as a central element of a good life and employment rates as a metric of a successful society was not a common assumption until after World War II." 

Some people go to alternative work though

#### chapter 4 

people must engage with the pathless path step by step

 I told the coach how much I enjoyed this and said that maybe one day I could do what she was doing. She looked at me quizzically and said, “it sounds like you’re already a coach, though?”

Her comment rocked me. She urged me to try coaching as a side gig. I spent the next few minutes making excuses for why this was not possible but I think I had been waiting for someone like her to push me in a new direction. I finally had somewhere to direct my emergent creative energy and I told her that I accepted the challenge

It took a year and a half for me to admit I did not enjoy my job. I had spent years crafting an idea of who I thought I should be and working hard to find jobs that matched this idea. It was hard to admit that the foundation that I thought I had been building was incredibly fragile.

I took more responsibility for my life and started questioning my beliefs about work. When we talk about our jobs we often say, “I’m learning a lot!” In the first few years working in consulting, this was true. I grew in so many areas: writing, giving better presentations, communication skills, and research. A few years into the path, however, the things I was incentivized to learn became specific to the organization, such as navigating political conflicts and adopting behaviors, dress, and attitudes that signaled I might be a future company leader. I sucked at these things and my motivation tanked.

Daniel Vassallo describes experiencing a similar shift ten years into his career at Amazon: “Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing – almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.” He came to the conclusion that “only intrinsic motivation lasts” and decided to leave a comfortable six‑figure salary behind and create a life designed around flexible work, his interests, and his family.4

daniel vassallo "only intrinsic motivation lasts"

As I sat there I didn't know how to want it anymore"

Based on the experiences of others who leave the default path, this stage of contradiction is common. You take a last stand, doubling down on the existing path despite all evidence that it is no longer working.


I turned down the offer and started to ask harder questions. Why was I trying to get a raise when I knew I was not in a good environment? What was I seeking? Why did I keep changing jobs every two years? What was that pebble in my shoe really telling me?

These questions inspired an idea: what if I paired making less with working less? 


#### Building wisdom

> If we are going to imagine a new way forward for our work and our lives, we need to understand where our current ideas from work come from and how they have changed.



Philosophy of science. Theory and experiment are not separate they are linked.

Need to experiment with yourself.

The default path might be best. Don't need to be dogmatic.


Issue is the UK is that you're not allowed to break the mould.

In America you have to be special, and that leads into signalling e.g. valedictorian.

#### other quotes
#### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

Introduces the idea of the pathless path

#### Chapter 2

Millerd's journey chasing prestige, and the beginning of his grwoth from his health and personal crisises.

Alan Watts - "the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing...we look for this security by fortifying and enclosing ourselves in innumerable ways. We want the protection of being 'exclulusive' and 'special'"

C.S. Lewis - "...in all men’s lives at certain periods…one of the most dominant elements is the desire to be inside the local Ring and the terror of being left outside.”

Millerd - "So much of my identity had been connected with being a high achiever...When I was sick, I would have traded every last credential for a single day of feeling okay.."

#### Chapter 3

Millerd reviews the history of work and where work beliefs come from. He finds that he doesn't want to do a bullshit job, but he also doesn't want to get caught up trying to do more and more.

"In Weber’s view, a “traditionalist” view of work is one where people work as much as they need to maintain their current lifestyle, and once that aim is achieved, they stop working."

"It might surprise you that in Greece, during the time of Aristotle more than 2,000 years ago, work was simply considered a necessary evil. The prime aim of life according to philosophers was “Eudaimonia,” which translates literally as “happiness,” but is better expressed as “flourishing.” In Aristotle’s words, “the more contemplation, the more happiness there is in a life.”

" [In ancient Greece] Contemplating one’s place in the universe was seen as one of the most worthwhile things to do and at minimum, more important than the “money-making life,” which Aristotle described as “something quite contrary to nature…for it is merely useful as a means to something else.”"

"...13th-century Catholic priest Thomas Aquinas, argues “labor is only necessary ‘naturali ratione’ [by natural reason] for the maintenance of individual and community.” People should be expected to work, but the reason is to meet the needs of our families and communities."

"Calvin paired Luther’s increase in individual freedom with the idea that everyone is predestined to serve God through a specific calling. Working hard in the area of one’s calling determines the status of a person’s relationship with God."

"By the time I graduated from college in 2007, the idea that life should be built around a good corporate job was so sacred that almost everyone had forgotten that only 100 years earlier most people worked on farms."


"“helping people find meaning in their work is complex and profound, going far beyond the relative superficialities of satisfaction or engagement. Their research found that instead of joy, meaningful experiences were “associated with mixed, uncomfortable, or even painful thoughts and feelings, not just a sense of unalloyed joy and happiness.”

"Sociologist André Gorz spent the latter half of the 20th writing about the role of work in society. He argued that many countries had evolved into places where the primary way one gained “membership” in society was through formal work. He called these places “wage-based societies” where the central ethic was, “never mind what work you do, what counts is having a job.“

e.g. parent who becomes a full-time caretaker

"In addition to ignoring this new way of working, we also ignore the enormous amount of wasted energy and effort that is a part of many jobs. In his book Bullshit Jobs, David Graeber detailed stories of people working in jobs where they were personally convinced that nothing they did was of value. However, if you find yourself in such a job, it is rarely worthwhile to point this out to other people."

#### Chapter 4

The ultimate way you and I get lucky is if you have some success early in life, you get to find out early it doesn’t mean anything. – David Foster Wallace

When he got raises or promotions the discomfort would subside but never disappear. Slowly, he became more curious about that feeling and realized that despite his external success, he had become a “passive participant” in his life. Eventually, this convinced him to embark on his own pathless path.

As I started to pay attention, I slowly came to realize the reality that I had been living in was an invisible bubble, one of my own creation. I started to push the edges of that reality and wasn’t sure what would happen.

If there are clear boundaries to behavior within a given field of endeavor, then there is also great freedom to adapt and imagine within those lines. These boundaries, however, should always be tested to see if they are actually still real. It takes conscious acts by individuals to test these edges. – David Whyte

Rather than participating in meetings as a good team member, I observed them as a visiting anthropologist. I saw my colleagues with new eyes. Are they happy? What kind of pain or challenges are they dealing with? Is this how they want to be spending their time?

Once you ask these questions there is no going back. Not because of the contradictions in other people’s lives, but because it makes it difficult to live in contradiction in your own life.

My final list included four items: health, relationships, fun & creativity, and career. Since 2013, this list pops up on my phone at 8:30 a.m. each morning. Staring at those four items, in that order, was scary. Without knowing it, I had embraced a question that would shape my decisions: “How do you design a life that doesn’t put work first?”

Creativity requires faith. Faith requires that we relinquish control. – Julia Cameron

Austin Kleon, a prolific creator and writer, says that “creative work runs on uncertainty; it runs on not knowing what you’re doing." The creative work of finding a new life path is similar...Do I know where this will take me? No, but I’m excited to find out.”

"The only way through this kind of uncertainty is to embrace what author and educator George Leonard called “the spirit of the fool.” He argued that when you start learning anything new it will make you “feel clumsy, that you’ll take literal or figurative pratfalls. There’s no way around it.” George Leonard

"My biggest barrier was my inability to imagine an alternative life. My creative experiments were exciting, but they didn’t suggest an obvious next step. It was easier to aim toward another raise or promotion than daring to ask myself deeper questions."

William Reilly’s book How To Avid Work: Your life is too short and too valuable to fritter away in work... If you don’t get out now, you may end up like the frog that is placed in a pot of fresh water on the stove. As the temperature is gradually increased, the frog feels restless and uncomfortable, but not uncomfortable enough to jump out. Without being aware that a chance is taking place, he is gradually lulled into unconsciousness.


"In 2008, attorney Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to a position in which he set the salaries of bank executives involved in the global financial crisis. He had to inform executives who made $5 million the previous year that they would only be making $1 million in the upcoming year. He expected them to be frustrated but understand, given the broader challenges in the economy. That’s not what happened. Most were outraged. He realized that “these corporate officials viewed their compensation as the sole barometer of self-worth.” He wasn’t lowering their salaries; he was dealing a blow to the essence of who they thought they were."

#### History of work


Easy to dismiss these ideas.


Sense of ownership is important in work.


we judge past people for immoral actions, e.g. jefferson owning slaves, churchill killing people. we will probably do the same today. there have always been humanitarians and there will always people who seek the greatest power they can
