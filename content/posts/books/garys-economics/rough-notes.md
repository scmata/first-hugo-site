Five competitors had been put through from each of five universities: LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Warwick. I guess as far as Citibank was concerned, other universities didn’t matter. That made twenty-five competitors, including me, and I’d now played with all of the LSE contingent. I fancied my chances.

By way of anecdote, I also went to LSE and studied in a department focused entirely on inequality and poverty, and their remedies. I also took economics and other modules focused on inequality. Gary's statements that such teaching/research doesn't exist is intentional fabrication.

Top 50th percentile of people would not be for improving income inequality (because they’re above the median)
