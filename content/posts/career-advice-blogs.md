folishly, I used to belive you could learn a lot of things from the internet. That's how I grew up.

Move quickly

Learn how to learn e.g. continually aim just beyong your current range, get deep knowledge on one topic, learn the value of tacit knowledge.

First principle thinking
e.g. Dimensional analysis is MECE

Find how to orient yourself/what you're smart at

then work hard and work smart for outsized returns

-it's a primitive emotion. we don't have much to be scared for now.


maintain perspective on what's really important
