difference between working hard/performative hard work and actualy hard work

there's a blog post somewhere saying that the first is easier



Life and career advice for ambitious young people

Much good advice is easy to understand, but [hard to implement](https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/). So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then re-read it frequently to keep yourself on track.

(there's even a trend of advice just for doing what you say you want to do (i.e implementing your habits))

there's no silver bullet. imagine asking your 80 year old self for a 500 word blog post on all the life advice you need. Impossible. However, this can help you unlock your potential.

you can't incorporate all knowledge has heurisics

let this serve as a reminder for how to orient yourself when you review.

probably just on how you should spend your effort and what mental models you might be missing. lots of knowledge is tacit.

best advice from people who've gone outside their path to imrpove their life?

best advice is a story that got simplified i.e. a fable

type 1 system will stress, need to give it to type 2 to absorb.

## Ben Kuhn on moving quickly
https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/

> There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important...  
> It’s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren’t just about churning out work—they’re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next...  
> That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn’t just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. Over time, that makes an enormous difference.

Related to this is the idea of being overly worried, which I think rational people are prone to. In most developed economies, you don't need to worry that much. That means our (primitive) brains overfire. Learn to take risks.

## On perspective and goals

Generally you can only have one idea that's top of your mind. This is a powerful idea because you will get drawn towards it.

#### Anonymous, Becoming a Magician—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:

> The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.

> Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). … It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.

#### Paul Graham on top of mind thoughts
[only one north star](https://paulgraham.com/top.html)
> I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I'd thought. I knew it was a good time to have ideas. Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.


#### Terrence Tao on prematurely obssessing on a single big problem
While having a north star is important, you shouldn't prematurely obsess on a single “big problem”
>There is a particularly dangerous occupational hazard in this subject: one can become focused, to the exclusion of other mathematical activity (and in extreme cases, on non-mathematical activity also), on a single really difficult problem in a field (or on some grand unifying theory) before one is really ready (both in terms of mathematical preparation, and also in terms of one’s career) to devote so much of one’s research time to such a project. 

In other words, whenever you solve a big problem, it often comes from gaining experience solving smaller problems and scaling them. [By continually aiming just beyond your current range.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/continually-aim-just-beyond-your-current-range/)

> Among chess players, it is generally accepted that one of the most effective ways to improve one’s skill is to continually play against opponents which are slightly higher rated than you are. In mathematics, the opponents are unsolved or imperfectly understood mathematical problems, concepts, and theories, rather than other mathematicians; but the principle is broadly the same.

Note you can still target outsized opponents or massive problems, but this involves a slightly different type of scope. I have been given this advice too for example, when learning martial arts.

## Get good at one thing/learn what success feels like
there's a reason why so many parents put their kids in for a sport or to learn a musical instrument. Because it teaches you many life skills. even failing it you will learn a lot. 

Even without talent, I think you can get to 99% ability with enough time (~5-7 years of decent practice). Choose anything and commit to it for that time. In fact, I think a lot of very successful people had a natural aptitude for a certain area which either was noticed by their parents, or otherwise got them involved in a field early, which led to larger growth. 

How to [practice](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/haLsmqofELgGYMbXo/my-notes-from-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-by-cal-newport). Discipline. How much time is needed to get good at something. Once you have that reward curve in you, it can give you a blueprint for effort and reward for the rest of your life. For me, I can still remember what it feels like to push myself to the limit through athletics trianing.

You become much better at what you practice e.g. [Marques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURieQJVZIs) [Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCV2Q0qlWqA)

### How to do great things (and the nature of genius)

In summary you need to work hard on the right things that you enjoy. Doing just one will get you mediocre success. Both are important. For example, rowers put massive amounts of energy into training. When they're in the boat though they have to row at the right moments otherwise they'll slow the whole boat down. Training obessively won't just get you rewards. Counterintuively, someone who trains less but is better at technique will be better in a boat.

also  you will probably need a period of sacrifice to achieve big goals.

https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f9n

> Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard.

> As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out which kind you're suited for. And that doesn't just mean figuring out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn't mean that if you're 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What you're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even more on your interests. A deep interest in a topic makes people work harder than any amount of discipline can.

> Mozart was playing the violin at 3 years of age and received expert, focused instruction from the start. He was precocious, writing symphonies at age 7, but he didn't produce the work that made him a giant until his teens.  
> The same is true for Tiger Woods. He seems magical on the golf course, but he was swinging a golf club before he could walk, got great instruction and practised constantly from boyhood, and even today outworks all his rivals.  
> His genius has been laboriously constructed.

#### Finding happiness in the struggle

sisyphus struggle. [casey neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IiTdSnmS7E)

You will work on your career your whole life. It shoud be in an area you enjoy. Find a cause you could move a boulder for.

> You're not out here because it's easy. you do a lot of meaningless, purposeless, stupid things - you spend years focused on them and literally no one care but you. But you perservere anyway, you keep running. You keep running, you don't quit, you die trying. Because when you add up all those stupid meaningless obssessions and accomplishments, what they equal, what they add up to, is your life.

#### compound yourself

always produce

everyday you are solidfying your identity, like each day in a relationship you choose to be in the relationship.
e.g. olympians train. ask yourself, what are you getting better at?
    - for me oxford was first principles thinking, princeton real world problem solving.
    - if you spend 20% of your time watching TV, you are getting 20% better at watching TV every day.
- deliberate practice. imagine how a manager would assign you a task. perfect practice makes perfect (e.g. music), not just any practice. football training is very specific.

Ben Francis and Stuff Made Here make a point to learn every day.

make too many pots that you can't optimise each one (overwhelm yourself with practice). also train volume to train discipline and covering all the situations e.g. how dagestan wrestlers train

## The importance of reflection
https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/

> Staring into the abyss means thinking reasonably about things that are uncomfortable to contemplate, like arguments against your religious beliefs, or in favor of breaking up with your partner. It’s common to procrastinate on thinking hard about these things because it might require you to acknowledge that you were very wrong about something in the past, and perhaps wasted a bunch of time based on that (e.g. dating the wrong person or praying to the wrong god). However, in most cases you have to either admit this eventually or, if you never admit it, lock yourself into a sub-optimal future life trajectory, so it’s best to be impatient and stare directly into the uncomfortable topic until you’ve figured out what to do.

## you can move faster than you think

https://danluu.com/p95-skill/

> Reaching 95%-ile isn’t very impressive because it’s not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn’t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it’s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.  
> Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I’m also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The “one weird trick” is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.

https://sive.rs/kimo
> Kimo’s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that “the standard pace is for chumps” — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.


[the 20 hour rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)
> Just 20 hours is enough to become “reasonably good” at any skill. 

> 1. Deconstruct the skill - Break the skill down into its most basic parts. Which parts are necessary for hitting the goal you have? (i.e. if your goal is to sing a song in Korean, you can primarily focus on pronunciation, not learning a bunch of vocabulary)
> 2. Learn enough to self correct - Learn enough to realize when you're making mistakes.
> 3. Remove barriers to practice - Turn off your phone, unplug the TV. Put your guitar, piano, language book in the middle of your room, not behind your stack of dirty laundry.
> 4. Practice for at least 20 hours - Commit to 20 hours from the start. You're going to be frustrated at times, so committing beforehand will help you push through the frustration.


#### productivity and management

interesting how learning stuff like entrepreneurship, business, and leadership/mentorship and management also apply to yourself. . judge yourself from outside your perspective, you are very biased. you could be the only thing that's conscious. you are not aware of your brain. separate your thoughts and feelings, and understand the flow between them.

what do people think about you

e.g. thinking about things systematically

ben kuhn where he said project management isn't just about trying as hard as possible
https://www.benkuhn.net/tmgr/

> As an IC, you can often get away with a very simple time-management strategy:
> Decide what your one most important thing is.
> Work on it until it’s done.
> GOTO 1
> As a team lead, this isn’t going to work, because much more of your work is interrupt-driven or gets blocked for long periods of time. 

https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/#make-success-inevitable

> A common trait of high-agency people is that they take accountability for achieving a goal, not just doing some work. There’s a huge difference between the following two operating modes:

> 1. My goal is to ship this project by the end of the month, so I’m going to get people started working on it ASAP.
> 2. My goal is to ship this project by the end of the month, so I’m going to list out everything that needs to get done by then, draw up a schedule working backwards from the ship date, make sure the critical path is short enough, make sure we have enough staffing to do anything, figure out what we’ll cut if the schedule slips, be honest about how much slop we need, track progress against the schedule and surface any slippage as soon as I see it, pull in people from elsewhere if I need them…

## College Advice

- https://www.benkuhn.net/college/#fnref:3


#### extra points
- You get rich by owning things
- Do your best to meet good people for your circle and inspiring people. Just being around Olympains and seeing how hard they work will really show you. Similarly for high performing executives.
- get as close as you can to people who define your definition of success. your definition will probably change, but being able to interact with them will give you way more data than reading about them or watching podcasts on them
- Maintain perspective on what's really important (at the end of the day your happiness)
- People aren't born great at things. People can be born with an aptitude for things, which often needs to be discovered and then developed. Walt Disney's first animation went bankrupt.Steve Jobs wasn't a great CEO at first. JK Rowling single mother living on welfare who only got the first Harry Potter book accepted by the 13th publisher.   We remember others for their achievements, but we forget they also often made big mistakes.
- Try and judge yourself from an external point of view. We are automatically egotistical. Common misconceptions: people usually care less than you think.

Stuff I want to work on
- Moving quickly
- Removing fear from my decisions
- Taking advantage of my opportunities
- Selling myself
