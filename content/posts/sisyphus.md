"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." 

This quote has been ringing in my head the last 3 months. Camus' original essay is pretty dense and so far I've read about half, but I wanted to share my thoughts so far.

If you're not familiar, the Ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus describes a man who is sentences to push a boulder up a mountain for eternity (after doing some bad things)... doesn't sound very happy to me right?

Yet, what Camus is trying to explain to us is that we all have a boulder. After all, "We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.". After taking a break, or thinking too long or a bad illness you may think to yourself, why am I really pushing this boulder?

And no one has an answer. Kiekkergard says we should belive in god, Satre says we should choose a meaning and live by that (I think). Camus says all of that is a load of crap. Because all of these beliefs take a leap of faith.

You may think your life purpose is to be the best painter you can be. Or the best father. Or the best Christian or Muslim, or other belief. But Camus points out, all of these leaps of faith are pretend. One cannot rationally justify one over the other. Each philosophy has gaps in their argument.

As it turns out, humans like explanations for things. But this desire for explanation comes up against the universe, who does not give us all those explanations. 

So what can we do? We must live with that fact. We cannot hide from it. To choose a given meaning means we define ourselves by that meaning. We judge our successes and failures by that God or that personal goal. This exists both on the life scale and the day scale - your life isn't any more worth living if you finished your checklist for today or not.

Instead, we must stare at this unknown and revolt. We must dance in the unknown. 

Life has no inherent meaning. It is scary but also freeing. Nobody can tell you how to live your life - not even yourself.  You have the freedom to live as you want. We get caught in linear thinking, thinking we have to live for our future selves. But in reality, the only life you live is in the present. 

Coming back to sisyphus though, what are we meant to do about it? 

For weeks, I was frustrated that Sisyphus would just end up at the bottom of the hill and be happy? I mean who would be happy with that?

But we are not Sisyphus. 



First of all, we can reach the top of our mountains. At least some of the ones we might define. Then the quote of lucky to see success doesnt matter. There will be more mountains of course, 

Next, we can choose our mountains. This is one of my favourite things. A lot of people in history and now, don't have much choice for their mountains, but many people do, and I like that.

( We also don't have to watch the boulder roll down the same hill every time. Sometimes it will roll in different directions. But the boulder is always with us, we are always attached to it. If you try exit the loop, you'll have to hop back on at some point) There's no way to sit back and observe.

Finally, at some point we will stop rolling our boulder. When we stop there's a chance we won't be able to see others admire how far we pushed it or how hard we pushed. But there's a quote I want to use

- "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones" - Confucious 

Maybe you could help create the pyramids so others have a good view. Or stack your boulders with other people so that they start off from a higher point of view. Or move a boulder out of the way.

But in the end it doesn't matter if you did any of this. THe people who made the pyramids and the people who just moved a rock both still just had a massive rock in front of them the whole time. So how do you feel about your boulder?

What mattered is 

Humanity builds upwards.


Help others live


Addendum: I'm curious to think whether Camus would have thought that an infinitely long life is worth living. Your life isn't defined by choices anymore, but you can still revolt.















Philosophy is essentially a history of disillusionments:

The Greeks believed in the power of reason to grasp the cosmos → but their metaphysics broke down.

Medieval scholastics built vast systems on God’s truth → but modern science overturned them.

Rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz, Hegel) tried to build perfect systems → each was later shown to be incomplete.

“Regrets” = the acknowledgment of what reason cannot reach.

“Impotences” = the repeated inability of human thought to deliver absolute certainty or meaning.

between a description that is sure but that teaches me nothing and
hypotheses that claim to teach me but that are not sure. 


There ends all my
knowledge, and the rest is construction. For if I try to seize this self

nothing but water slipping through my fingers. I


Between the certainty I have of my existence and the
content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled.
