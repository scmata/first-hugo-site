In a previous article (link), I mentioned the key items of consideration when applying to Oxbridge. GSCEs (normally relative to your year group in school), predicted A-level grades, personal statement, specific subject asssessment test (depends on subject) and interview. In many cases everything all the available information will be decided to 


The university will take into account the first several items together, and then combine these components to decide who to invite to interview. If you are invited to interview they will use all the information they already have as well as the interview to decide who they finally give an offer to. The main variation between subject is the rigor/importance of different components, as well as maybe not having a subject assessment test.
