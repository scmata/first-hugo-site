# Some questions I've had/heard

- Why do investment banks have employees all work insane hours (e.g. 80 hour weeks) instead of employing twice the amount of people who work normal (40 hour) weeks? -suggested by Luke
- What makes an xyz good? - Originally asked what makes a piece of research good? Realised this was a more open ended question than what it seemed. Can be applied to economy, job, life etc. with interesting answers.
- How can we make effective altruism more paltable/why doesn't everybody get on board with it?
- Wealth seems to be distributed on an exponential. Is it possible to create an economy where wealth is distributed on a different curve? e.g. a power law, or a linear curve (maybe even including universal basic income!)

The idea of wealth scaling exponentially makes some sense to me, since the amount of "value"/people tends to increase somewhat exponentially as you move upwards. (If for example each manager manages 3 people at the level below, a level 10 manager manages 59049 people, an increase of roughly 20 000 times)
