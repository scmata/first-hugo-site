An lazy shark had a friend he once swam into, the amitious shark. 

The ambiitious shark had one core question - why am I here? And each year he would find a different answer. One year it was to try and swim as fast as possible. Another it was to eat as much as possible, because he felt happy when he ate. Another it was to listen to his father, another it was to have and raise good kids. Another was to explore all the different seas.

However, each time he completed each goal he never felt complete. He would be really good at each one, but would do it too intensely. He would worry about doing it well, and study and ask questions all the time that 

His head was always in a different place. When he had just learnt how to swim well, all he could think about was eating. Once he was fat and full, all he could think about was how to please his father. Once he realised he couldn't live his father's perfect life and even because his father couldn't answer every question about how to live life, all he could think about was the next sea to learn about and explore. Once he had seen everything, he got obssessed with raising his kids. Once his kids were adults and didn't listen to him anymore he was old. Soon he was about to die.

Finally, instead of talking to the other sharks about how to swim faster, or find the tastiest fish or the most attractive wife he talked to them about their lives.

He realised that many of the other sharks had done similar things to what he had. Many others had travelled to different seas, had kids and tried to appease their fathers. Some had done some parts better than him. Some had done some parts worse.

However, most were content. The ambitious shark grew frustrated - becuase in all of his exploits he still felt like he was no closer to answering his question. However, the other sharks seemed to have no pressure to find an answer, and by and large they had lived similar lives.

 He dreamed of living longer, or of starting life again, so that maybe if he could live life differently or live longer he could get closer to answering his question. Yet death was coming from him. And strangely, many of his peers were 


ask about the memory of the ambiitious shark? he didnt leave much

And then he died. N


or maybe he has a brother that comes with him. Or rather a friend.


Every year the ambitious shark would cross paths. He would come back each year with a new exploit. One year he learnt how to swim quickly, one he ate a lot becuase he thought being full would make him happy.
