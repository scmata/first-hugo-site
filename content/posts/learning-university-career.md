The framework I use for learning in my 20s

The secret to maximise your learning in your 20s and beyond
The mistake people make when learning independently
The mistake I made while learning in university

The framework I use for learning socially to access hidden knowledge


-education is important, learning how to learn can 10x your development

you need to learn how to learn socially as well as independently

-the different types of learning environments you must maximise, if you are not in any of these you cannot learn


The more I gain experience, the more I realise education is a super power. However, education means a lot more than what you learn in class in school and university. I'm still learning how to make the most of an environment around me, and here are my tips/resources for self study, which can be a very powerful tool.

e.g. productivity
entrepreneurship

you must have directed conversations for this to work

observe orient decide act

learning 

find sources of knowledge
ask directed specific questions
implement lessons, get feedback and review

build measure learn

First of all, we need to be aware of the three ways of gaining knowledge. They are: 1. By being surrounded in an environment of people who possess a skill you do not, 2. By having a good teacher or mentor. A good teacher will be able to teach/explain what you ask them to, an excellent mentor will test and find the gaps in your knowledge, and give you the most important details. 3. By learning it independently. Usually by a combination of books, podcasts and the internet. The secret sauce that underlies all of these methods is applying the lesson you learn through trial and error (otherwise your learning is mood). When you are looking to learn a new skill, you want to maximise the environment or the quality of your teacher/mentors.

lots of people do these things intuitively


Next, you must 






In general, I think there are three ways of gaining knowledge. 1. By being surrounded in an environment of people who possess a skill you do not, 2. By having a good teacher or mentor. A good teacher will be able to teach/explain what you ask them to, an excellent mentor will test and find the gaps in your knowledge, and give you the most important details. 3. By learning it independently. Usually by a combination of books, podcasts and the internet. The 'secret sauce' that is the foundation to any of these methods is trial and error.

The error that I and many other people have made, is thinking that one style of learning will lead to success. This is often based on our personal histories, for me in school the learning we tie our best learning to excellent teachers. In university you learn primarily independently, since your professors don't have the time to spend with you like in school.


Since I have been able to learn so much independently, I falsely assumed that you can learn most things through the internet. This is indeed far from truth. So much so, Tyler Cowen says that even [summaries of the state of knowledge in different fields](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/work-on-these-things.html?commentID=160017231) is a big and relevant problem to work on, since so much of it is held orally/in our heads. (Also why if you have knowledge to share, I encourage you to publish yourself! I myself only really appreciated this a year or so after the first draft of this article.)

I've realised learning is a lot more social than these systems would lead us to believe (bar places than disincentivize collaboration through grading on a curve). The other component is being able to ask good questions, being able to listen to an explanation and probe it in an interactive manner, having the confidence to ask where people should point you to resources.

What do you need to do to learn socially?

you need access, you need to make the best use of resources
"plugged in" to real world, to network
most entrepreneurship ideas

most people don't actually chase their ambiitions, 
what if you could do it way faster

learning to work in a team

leadership 

how to extract knowledge from noisy environments

in the future i predict that somebody might write a book on maximising knowledge extraction in different environments

since there isn't one, you will have to resort to trial and error. Work in teams, lead a team (where you will realise that some team members know more than you).

we don't apply social learning with intention, we do it where it happens, where we happen to be in a team pursuing a certain goal

we don't do it oerall

learn to invent wheel, then innovate. E.g. learn entrepreneurship, learn pet based entrepreneurship, then innovate with your own pet shop

networking


you can onlu have one main goal in life (Joe rogan clip -what you think about in the shower etc)

-key directive/north star

-get up to date, and then innovate








vision/action 2x2 matrix

dreamers
vision
hamster


life compass
future sketch
quaterly quests

focus
productive days
balanced weeks




In fact, I got very good at independent learning. If only there were a set of lecture notes to any problem. However, problems in the real world don't have an acommpanying set of lecture  notes.



However, it actually is in the combination of different methods that lies the key to maximising learning.

Throughout my career so far, generally I have gone from one extreme to another. In school, you learn primarily through an extreme dedication to method 2, where you only learn in school and then forget about it when you leave. In university, you learn primarily through method 3, beecause professors and graduate students often don't have the time to spend with you. However, most of your career will be shaped by learning in between these two paths.

Since I have been able to learn so much independently, I falsely assumed that you can learn most things through the internet. This is indeed far from truth. So much so, Tyler Cowen says that even [summaries of the state of knowledge in different fields](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/work-on-these-things.html?commentID=160017231) is a big and relevant problem to work on, since so much of it is held orally/in our heads.

When I was applying to university, so many sources told me I need to learn how to become an "independent learner". To me this meant being able find and then stare long enough at textbooks/other source of media until I can figure out problems in a field. While I think I can do that pretty well now, I've realised learning is a lot more social than these systems would lead us to believe (bar places than disincentivize collaboration through grading on a curve). The other component is being able to ask good questions, being able to listen to an explanation and probe it in an interactive manner, having the confidence to ask where people should point you to resources.

Given this prior, we can talk about independent learning. First, I will say it pays dividends to learn how to learn and create a positive environment for yourself that allows deep work. Become comfortable with failure and potential embarrassment, it is a sign of progress. Secondly, the knowledge you learn will only have utility if you are able to use it. Active learning > passive learning. Third, is the time scale to expect. You will make the most gains at the beginning of your journey (you can learn enough to say you can technically do something after only [20 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)). As a completely qualtitative perspective, you will generally not be good at something in the beginning. Depending on your prior experience after 1-2 years you can become good enough that most average people will think you are good at it. You need 5 years to be actually good at something, that people within the activity will acknowledge your ability and you can teach the skill to some level. At least 10 years for a certain level of mastery.  

The wheel has been invented already! Good information is best, difficult to learn from enviornemtn since there is so much noise

the key is to focus on updating yourself so you're not catching up, then you know where you can contribute

trial and error is slow and expensive in time and money


What if instead of making a new platform we make a new algorithm?

Now here is my list of resources:



The secret fourth method is trial and error, however this forms a key component of all the other methods in fact. It is the "secret sauce".
