# A summary of geek heresy


Geek heresy was one of the most impactful books in the last year and it did a lot to reframe some of my models of impact and success. Here are my key takeaways:


Technology is not a silver bullet, even though we think it is:

Some facts:
Poverty decreased steadily in the US until 1970, where it has held steady until 2007, where it increased. Inequality has increased
- Several new technologies have been introduced since 1970. Such as the internet (Apple, GOogle, Microsoft) and the personal computer. But life for people hasn't improved. Why?



# bias towards tech
I am a recovering technoholic. I was once addicted to a technological way of solving problems.


“Talent is universal; opportunity is not.”

William Easterly foreign-aid critic

the technocratic illusion is to think that we suffer from a "shortage of expertise". What we have instead is either a shortage of caring or a shortage of capable follow-through. discernment is just the beginnig.

THE MYTH OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Cleantech entrepreneurs aimed for more than just success as most businesses define it. The cleantech
bubble was the biggest phenomenon—and the biggest flop—in the history of “social
entrepreneurship.” This philanthropic approach to business starts with the idea that corporations and
nonprofits have until now been polar opposites: corporations have great power, but they’re shackled
to the profit motive; nonprofits pursue the public interest, but they’re weak players in the wider
economy. Social entrepreneurs aim to combine the best of both worlds and “do well by doing good.”
Usually they end up doing neither.
The ambiguity between social and financial goals doesn’t help. But the ambiguity in the word
“social” is even more of a problem: if something is “socially good,” is it good for society, or merely
seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to receive applause from all audiences can only
be conventional, like the general idea of green energy.
Progress isn’t held back by some difference between corporate greed and nonprofit goodness;
instead, we’re held back by the sameness of both. Just as corporations tend to copy each other,
nonprofits all tend to push the same priorities. Cleantech shows the result: hundreds of
undifferentiated products all in the name of one overbroad goal.
Doing something dif erent is what’s truly good for society—and it’s also what allows a business to
profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by
a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.
