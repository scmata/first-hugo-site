The internet is an amazing tool. Never before in history has human knowledge been so accessible. The great part, most of it is out there free. However, you usually need to spend a lot of time cutting through the noise. I want to save you some of that time, so here are the best resources I've used to learn from 48 different areas. I've spent 3 hours+ with most of these books/youtube creators/podcasters, so they come with well-informed recommendations. 

Sidenote: Going through most of the content I'd ever consumed was a really insightful journey. It showed me just how much I've learned through the internet, as well as just how much power our internet feeds have on what we focus on. This has definitely inspired me to consume content more mindfully. I suggest others try the same experiment.

### Fitness and health ###

- In general I recommend joining a community such as a sports club if you can. Lots of knowledge here is contained orally in this field, and also requires multiple people to actually learn (e.g. you can't learn Judo online). Sports can form part of a great social community too.
- Depending on how advanced the scene you join is, it can be hard to find many people to learn from past a certain level. This is when internet learning can come into play, where you can use this community as a test bed for the insights you gain
- The habit is the most important thing. If you want to go to the gym, even showing up to sit there to look at the plates is better than staying at home. Eventually your boredom will force you to do something. **Showing up is more important than being perfect** . (Arnold Shwarzenaegger) 
- Within this field especially, it is useful to learn what it actually means to push yourself consistently, most people don't know this feeling. The best athletes can utilise 100% of the capacity their body offers  (e.g Magnus Midtbo)

- Fitness is a combiantion of flexibility/mobility, strength, cardiovascular fitness. And then there is also coordination, agility and mental awareness which is sport dependent. The first three aspects are the easiest to develop individually since they have more eyes on them and are more transferable between fields.

######  Cardiovascular fitness
- Just get outside. Start walking and then running. (5km of walking burns roughly the same amount of calories as 5km of running, it just takes longer.) 
- Couch to 5k is a popular starting point if you want to start running
- Learn to skip/jump rope if you have less time. (HIT workouts)
###### Calisthenics
- FitnessFAQs, Chris Heria, Geek Climber, The Bioneer, Minus the Gym
###### Strength
Focus on showing up, work hard and get your 'noob gains' (building muscle mass and strength is much easier in the ~first year of training).
- AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, More Plates More Dates

###### Mobility
- Movement by David [(start here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNCyC4gV_34&t=244s&ab_channel=MovementbyDavid)

##### Basketball

##### Martial arts
Not all of these are creators that will necessarily be important to you to get better, however they can be very interesting/put the sport/art in context.

###### Motivation
These include either incredible athletes or fitness inspiration from an uncommon background. Adding these to your feed may improve your algorithm.
- Magnus Midtbo, Anton Fomenko, Browney, Brently G, Dan Jeong, Jujimufu


### Programming
The best way to learn is to learn by doing. Also it is useful to learn version control/git after a bit of experience.
##### Web development
- The Odin Project

##### Game development
Learning how to develop games is a very real way to learn how to program. In addition, popular game engines like Unity can be used in academic research as well for certain projects due to their general ease of use.
(Some key words: Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine)
- Pirate Software ([Start here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMc-GKv5olA))

#####  CAD 
The good thing about this area is that once you learn one tool you can kind of use them all. Fusion360 is free for students and generally a good place to start.
- Fusion360 [This course seems good but I haven't checked it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&ab_channel=ProductDesignOnline)
- product designer maker (YT)


### Self development
I have by far gained the most value from Ali Abdaal. Watch his stuff.

##### Mindfulness
This can change your life. There a lots of ways to get started. I suggest starting a Bullet Journal. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24y_QdPDZ4)
 for an overview.

##### Public speaking
- Vinh Giang. [Watch this video first.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-shbSFc48E&ab_channel=VinhGiang) His shorts are also very useful. The more practice you get the better too.

##### Talking to people

##### Learning random skills
These creators learn a new skill every week/month. They can show you how learning doesn't need to be scary (although it will require a lot of failure in the beginning).
- Mike Boyd, Mike Shake, Max's monthly challenge

##### Skincare
- Reddit [r/SkincareAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index/). All the basics of skincare you need to know with a science-based approach. The basics are cleanse, exfoliate, moisturise, suncream every day.

### Math, science and engineering
3Blue1Brown is the GOAT in this area

##### Math

These resources are centered on the UK. My general advice is to clear your debt, get an emergency fund and then invest in an index fund. However, do your own research before investing money.
