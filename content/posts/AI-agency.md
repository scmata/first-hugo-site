How to prevent AI taking your job: 

Why AI won't replace knowledge work

AI won't replace knowledge work because it is fundamentally a tool. Jobs that are based on tools to fit a specification such as software engineering will be lost. However, for every specification there's someone who designs that specification - and that is something a lot more difficult to outsource to engineering.

I think about AI right now as a library of human knowledge that is extremely easily queried to find the most relevant issues to your problem. However, there is much more to human knowledge than having the right answer. This is where the whole idea of wisdom and having to make your own mistakes comes from


effienciey improver for tasks that have a clear output
library of relevant knowledge for strategy and complex tasks
tool to assist in metacognition -> like dad giving you advice

AI can give you conclusions like if your dad told you what to think or a calculator told you the answer, but it's on you to figure out if that solution actually makes sense.

a lot thinking goes into what question to ask and how to evaluate the answer

if you just want to use its capabiliy as a tool you will be able to get more right answers more quickly (engineering problems), but you won't have a mental model of when these models fail or are out of distribution.

Or you won't be able to do research.

creating a model of the answer

-people learn through experience

-you actually understand something when you have a generative/actual mental model of what something is like

“I often look at people’s achievements and think: I wish I’d done that. More rarely, I see the work that went into those achievements and think: I wish I were doing that. Chase the latter.” (a)
