even invention of money "evolved" to pay blood feuds.

from machivelli POV the good guy doesn't alwasy win or the bad guy. the guy with the most power does, moral are second

demonracy exists not because it is inherently better, but it is more stable

that one article about if you are good/your skills

like at the bottom you'll be tae advantage of, but at the top you can be very successful

success incentivises being good?

ig on large scale you need to be good e..g as  CEO or you'll be replaced, if you harm enough people or have a big enough scandal, if you dont have the ability to repress peole, they will find a way to kick you out or overthrow you
but if you are bad in a way people cant measure, see or understand, you can get more power

->>>>> thereore increasing information and informaton symmetry is vey important

even like climate change is one of these things when it's future generations they cant vote so easier to take advantage of. and in the short term you cant fall behind cus the technology is ess developed than fossil fuels


good tech can outcrowd bad? e.g. brainrot roblox games vs good games ig. people also need agency to gifure out what is good for them (which is hard for kids)

also happiness doesnt increase with power so what is the motivation for it

today 11.7.25, so maybe I looked at it yday?? i think so


also another article saying that humans are also unique because culture is malleable between different genreation

https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ian-morris-big-picture-history/#highlights


an Morris:The thing that strikes me most about human values is how variable they are: you can go to two communities quite close to each other geographically, and they will have entirely different attitudes about things like gender relationships, whether hierarchy is a good or a bad thing, all kinds of stuff like this, wildly different ideas about this. The malleability of our values is the thing that really struck me.

Ian Morris: I think that comes about because, unlike other animals, we have evolved biologically to the point where we can also evolve culturally. We have cumulative cultural evolution which is something that really no other species of animal exactly has. We can think up new ways to do things. We can tweak these, add to them over the centuries. Just like every other kind of animal, we act in response to the environments in which we live. But unlike any other kind of animal, we can do so cumulatively, changing the way we behave without having to evolve biologically into a different kind of animal.


# Is technology good?

need to read on this more -> main thing i need to understand more is tech. determinism, since i just found out about it as a term

[dafoe offers some nuance on it](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/allan-dafoe-unstoppable-technology-human-agency-agi/?t=1224#articles-books-and-other-media-discussed-in-the-show)

[the interviewer of morris also offers some counter arguments](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ian-morris-big-picture-history/)



Over the long term:
Technology and innovation can help improve productivity. Producitivity can help improve standard of living.

Also technology at a period shapes the best way to accrue power by changing our capabilities e.g. having democracy is easier once we have the news to communicat einformation. (This links to [ian morris](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ian-morris-big-picture-history/)), having nukes adds to peace (mutually assured destruction). Social media e.g. retweets encouraging toxicitiy.

And my retort was technology doesn’t force us; it merely opens the door — and it’s military–economic competition that forces us through. Dafoe

Individual level can be shaped but macro level can't be?

some of it we can choose (individual level e.g. seat belts or bus thing), but some thigns are inevitable. Like capiralism produces more power over communism, not because it was inherently more moral.

Can you ask like how would a politician want technology to be made? though most don't know that mich about technology

also most engineers don't know much about poltiics - the crossover of the space is super imporant tho

-lol but in school they told us about patent law.


companies want to gain more profit, but if they are forced to be less ethical because of competitors, they don't have much choice or they;ll get forced out e.g. externalize the costs of poor safety for [factory workers ](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-as-normal-technology)

or race to the bottom like tiktok


technology development is often framed as this tension between companies who want to maximise profit (or shareholder value) and government who want to try and improve the worth of the public.

wealthy founders can help change the rules of the game to be fairer (but they usually don't want to until the public forces them too-they can try and make the world more fiar), by talking with the government

What can we do?

-We can aim to create technology that creates fairer games (e.g. enhanced communication for democracy and trust)
-When we do create technology we can try make sure it is fair (e.g. making sure it's not biased against one race for example, or that it doesn't promote like conspiracy or fraud )
-We can work with governments to add regulation to new technology to avoid exploitation -> this only works if it improves economic growth in the long run (so technology is still at the origin of providing game structure-otherwise another nation with different or worse morals will take over by being more effective)
- We can work on tools that are meant to help people 
    -   this is kind of a tree, since a lot of technologies can be used for good and bad. and the good/bad goes down a tree because a lot of products depend on other technology. (medicine is the mainly one which is only good.) but at the end of the day we can focus on the good application first, and producing something which is mostly good with a few bad parts (e.g. email with good stuff but also scams) is a lot better
    - This is hard tho because of the tech. determinism argument, since economics will incentivise the bad versions. but it is harder/slower if we all on an individual level focus on the good options
    (medicine based mainly-even robot surgery can be used mailciously though)
- We can use all the other ways we have of improving the world, and use technology to advance that.  (we can use the power or money that technology or our tech jobs have to improve the world around us, with family, donating to charity, spreading awareness for causes or poltical influene)
- we can just make new technology, and leave the task of applying it in a good way to all the other points above


What are the afforances of technology? e.g. what is the bad side of each of these points, and what do they have in common

differences between base and downstream technology, maybe in the context of social media

when introducing a new technlogy it can do the baseline thing of improving prductivity, then it or its downstream products can either be developed for good or bad purposes. What affects this is mainly economic-military competition (i.e. power) competition. (And this usually relies on cooperation for the optimal outcome? Not over history though... e.g. slavery)


Then you cans till decide ot focus on good vs bad and it's probably mostly worthwhile, but external forces will force you to choose the outcome with the most power over the long term e.g. first with economic competition going out of business on a company level, then on a global scale with economc and military power. so in the long term it doesn't matter as much?

the other perosn's research on micro/macro level effects being different. mciro you can have an effect but macro you can't?

but if tech. determinism isn't true, we can focus on making the good side of tech regardless



those students Osamede knew are good at playing the game, but can they help change it e.g. with internships in IB etc.

is the game we play eg. capitlaism the best way to have power?

stuff might change when we have surplus though and everyone has enugh, does war make as much sense? would people want to go to war as much? e.g. the happiness curve, if everyone's at the top, there's no marginal gain.



even brain interface might be good or bad


. The fact that early on in the development of technology, people didn’t know what the end result was, and they had many visions that were competing — and so it wasn’t foreordained that the bicycle would look the way it does, or the plane would look the way it does.

if you create the technology first e.g. the bike and provide a solution, then maybe other worse solutions will be more difficult to emerge? not sure tho e.g. social media and tiktokification

You know, we name revolutions after technology: the agricultural revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and so forth.


why do bad technologies get made? they're bad and they scam people and they can tell e.g. roberry, they're bad or suboptimal but it's not that easy for people to realise e.g. BBL or other long term things like poppi soda and sugar, it just seems better


hank green said we will not look on this era of the internet fondly wih social media, slop etc. I can't remember where. maybe starved for information video.

amazon


if a lot of people listen to this advice, it can be very impactful e.g. oxford engineers

 We can use all the other ways we have of improving the world, and use technology to advance that. 

 -> but the point of this is that the technology we make is not inherently good or bad and might be used for different things. e.g. phones, guns. Even if I wanted to make nuclear power, I would also end up making nukes which people could use to kill people.

 Conclusion before was gna be that people are inherently good so they'll prioritise making the good outcome with technology even though most technology can be used for good and bad things but this isn't completely correct becuase there's some feedback going on. Cus technology affects the games which affect our incentive structures so they effect our morality.


the main idea so far is if technological determinism is true or not.

if it is, then we focus on making good decisions in the short term/about everything else we can while embracing the macroforces technology puts because we can't escape them without our community being overpowered by people who embrace the most effective way to use the technology

if it isn't, my original thesis is correct and we need to focus on how to make the most of the good and minimise the bad abilities of technology.


physical and internet infrastructure

Maybe in a way, the easiest one to accept is what we can call “technological politics.” This is the idea that individuals or groups can express their political goals through technology.

design of social networks can greatly shift the tone of conversation and people’s behaviour. 



Only way to answer this question really is looking at the past.

Most technology you can't control its direct influence. E.g. mobile phone, you can use it for fraud or to be more productive. However, the structure of societies provide more incentive for cooperation and the good side.

However, you can control its implementation.
or giving guns to romans

So is creating a new tool nherently good or bad for society and should you focus your energy on that?

in the long run it improves productivity but might affect the "game w're playing"/incentive structure for societies. THe first is a given, the second we can affect partially but sometimes not much.

even like beer, or a drug that makes you happy all the time, or the metaverse.

founders like Zuck are aware of how technology shapes society (because the way they make the most profit is using the network effect and making a tool that everyone needs to use or they'll fall behind) (Cleo ABrams podast with Zuck)
and maybe Colin and Samir with snapchat CEO
-this effect most directly seen in social media who  fundamentally are incentivised to change the infrastructure of how we communication






infrastructure/necessary tools affect how we live

tools affect what we can do






can either focus on being a really good researcher or a realy good technologist


Allan Dafoe: The second point I want to make is that there’s this great example from UK history, where I think this dynamic is really well illustrated.

This is from Thomas Hughes, this historian of energy systems. He looks at the UK energy system, which initially had these local power plants and local energy systems that Thomas argues were better suited to the United Kingdom’s notion of democracy: there was decentralised energy provision, it was much more under the control of localities, it wasn’t this big national energy system.

And that persisted up to World War II, when the cost constraints that it imposed became excessive, and the UK made the decision to adopt more of a national grid. So there is again: this story of one certain way of living, arguably aligned with the political ethos of the community, persisting until the cost constraints become excessive, often driven by this crisis of conflict.

economics/productivity-mankiw

a Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living
Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services
The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 2011, the
average American had an income of about $48,000. In the same year, the average
Mexican earned about $9,000, the average Chinese about $5,000, and the average
Nigerian only $1,200. Not surprisingly, this large variation in average income is
reflected in various measures of quality of life. Citizens of high-income countries
have more TV sets, more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare, and a longer life
expectancy than citizens of low-income countries.
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States,
incomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for
changes in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years.
Over the past century, average U.S. income has risen about eightfold.
What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and
over time? The answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount
of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input. In nations where
workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per hour, most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less productive,
most people endure a more meager existence. Similarly, the growth rate of a nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is
simple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary determinant of living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance.
For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws
for the rise in living standards of American workers over the past century. Yet the
real hero of American workers is their rising productivity. As another example,
some commentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan and
other countries explained the slow growth in U.S. incomes during the 1970s and
1980s. Yet the real villain was not competition from abroad but flagging productivity growth in the United States.
The relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound
implications for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect living standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goods
and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity
by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology

the framework from 100M offers

on some levels you have no choice how the technology you create is used.


Learning to use something as a tool is different to creating with it or advancing it. Takes different mindsets.

Also difference between humanities learning and engineering. Humanities you discuss ideas.

Engineering you figure out the best way to use tools to produce real world artefacts.
(also how to set up and manage organisations to produce things better)

Physics you get back to discussing ideas.

Do humans control technological change? [00:09:17]
Rob Wiblin: Let’s open by talking about the work that you did in your previous incarnation, which was as an academic. So I think you did your thesis back in the early 2010s on technological determinism as the main focus. And I think the paper that came out of that opens with, “Who — if anyone — controls technological change?” What was the academic debate there that you were reacting to or trying to be a part of?

Allan Dafoe: So my academic trajectory had a number of chapters. The first was on technological determinism, which we can come to. Just for completeness, the second was on great power politics, and peace specifically — which actually led to a lot of work that I think continues to be relevant to the question of AI and AGI governance — and then I also did some statistics and causal inference work, which has some relevance to thinking about AI today.

Turning back to technological determinism, I would say I first came to this in undergrad, reflecting on what shapes history and how we can do good and how we can kind of steer the trajectory of developments in a positive direction.

And an insight I had was that history is not just the sum of all of our efforts. It’s not just that we all kind of push in different directions and then you take the sum and that’s what you get. Rather, there’s these general equilibrium effects that economists often talk about, where it may be that for every unit of effort you push in one direction, the system will kind of push back with an equal force, or sometimes a weaker force, sometimes a stronger force.

So when you’re in such a system, it’s very important to understand these structural dynamics. Why does the system sometimes resist efforts or sometimes amplify efforts? Why do you see these really astounding patterns in macrohistory?

For example, if you look at patterns of GDP growth, there’s these famous curves where, after the devastation of World War II, both Germany and Japan completely rebound within less than a decade and then kind of return to their prewar trajectory.

And we’ve seen Moore’s law, which is just an astounding trend. It’s not just that it continues, that transistor density is increasing exponentially; it’s very much a line — so you can predict where we’ll be quite precisely years in advance. We now have scaling laws which have given us sort of our generation’s Moore’s law, which again seems to allow us to predict years in advance how large the models will be, how capable — for example, on loss and so forth.

There’s a number of other macro phenomena that seem quite persistent. The growth of civilisation: I talked about or looked at these trends in what you can call the maximum — so maximum energy processing of a civilisation, also things like the height of buildings, the durability of materials. Really just most functional properties of technology over time have gotten more functional, so the speed of transportation and so forth.

Robert Wright, in summarising the literature, writes that, “archaeologists can’t help but notice that, as a rule, the deeper you dig, the simpler the society whose remains you find.” There’s more generally an observation, which is almost a truism, that certain kinds of technology are so complex or difficult that they come after other forms of technology. It’s hard to imagine nuclear power coming before coal power, for example. So there’s all these macro phenomena and trends in technology, and it’s important to explain them.

Now, this naive explanation would say if history is just the sum of what people try to achieve, then it’s human will that’s produced all these trends, including the reliable tick-tock of Moore’s law.

But not all the trends are positive. I know you’ve reflected on the agricultural revolution, which evidence suggests was not great for a lot of people. The median human, probably their health and welfare went down during this long stretch from the agricultural revolution to the Industrial Revolution. Of course it gave rise to inequality, warfare, and various other things. And there’s other trends that different societal groups resisted.

So in short, I don’t think the answer is history is just the sum of what people try to do. It depends of course on things like power, on timing, on the ecosystem of what’s functional and what’s possible and what’s not, on what technology enables. So I wanted to make sense of this.

Rob Wiblin: I guess the thing that we have to try to reconcile here is: on the one hand, we see these trends that seem like they’re not really responsive to any person’s particular decisions. It’s a little bit like the psychohistory in Foundation, where you just have these broad trends where everyone is just an ant in this broader process and it’s not obvious that anything that any particular individual did was able to shift things.

On the other hand, technology, at least so far, doesn’t have its own agency. It does seem like in fact it’s humans doing all of the actions that are producing these outcomes. And couldn’t they, in principle, if they really hated what was happening, try to shift it? We feel like we have agency right now over how society goes, or we feel that we at least have some agency.

So how do you reconcile this macro picture — where it seems like humans don’t have that much control over technology, at least historically — with the micro picture, where we feel like we do now. Am I understanding it right?




In Foragers, Farmers and Fossil Fuels Ian presents a provocative alternative: human culture gradually evolves towards whatever system of organisation allows a society to harvest the most energy, and we then conclude that system is the most virtuous one. Egalitarian values helped hunter-gatherers hunt and gather effectively. Once farming was developed, hierarchy proved to be the social structure that produced the most grain (and best repelled nomadic raiders). And in the modern era, democracy and individuality have proven to be more productive ways to collect and exploit fossil fuels.



maybe this just does down to the question if people are inherently good, and my most basic answer rn on a macro level they're just incentivised by the structure of the game/society we're in e.g. maximisiming shareholder value
and technology only gives us more capabilities


hence the question is not how do we make technology good, but how do we create systems that make people as good as possible/ how do we structure and incentiveise society

e.g. how to measure life and also economics in general, people respond to metrics, but poorly designed metrics can lead to sub optimal outcomes. e.g. selling the wrong product example because you get a bigger commision

Machiavelli kind of says this. game theory more or less formalises it to an extent
