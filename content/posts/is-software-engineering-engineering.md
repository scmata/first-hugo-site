self learning -> coding is different from engineering


are software engineers actually engineers?


ChatGPT said:
Great question — and one that sparks debate in both tech and traditional engineering circles.

Short answer:
Yes, software engineers are generally considered engineers, but it depends on how you define "engineer."

Longer answer:
✅ Why yes, they are:
Systematic Problem Solving:
Software engineers use structured methods (e.g., design patterns, software architecture) to solve complex problems, similar to how civil or mechanical engineers design bridges or machines.

Design under Constraints:
Like traditional engineering, software engineering involves optimizing trade-offs (speed vs. security, scalability vs. cost, etc.).

Lifecycle & Maintenance:
Software is designed, built, tested, deployed, and maintained — just like physical systems.

Accredited Programs & Certifications:
Many university programs are ABET-accredited under engineering faculties. Some countries even have professional engineer (P.Eng) pathways for software.

❌ Why some say no:
No Physical Laws:
Traditional engineering relies heavily on physics and material science. Software engineering deals more with logic and abstraction.

Less Regulation:
Civil and electrical engineers often require licenses (PE, CEng, etc.) to sign off on work affecting public safety. Software engineers usually don’t — unless working in highly regulated sectors (e.g., medical, aerospace).

Varied Entry Paths:
Many successful software engineers are self-taught or have unrelated degrees. This flexibility is rare in traditional engineering fields.

Think of it this way:
Software engineering is engineering in the sense of designing and maintaining complex systems in a disciplined way.

But it’s less constrained by regulation and physical realities, making it more fluid and accessible.

Bonus comparison:
Field	Requires license?	Regulated?	Uses physics?	Design-focused?
Civil Engineering	✅ Often	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Electrical Eng.	✅ Often	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Software Engineering	❌ Rarely	⚠️ Sometimes	❌ No	✅ Yes

Let me know if you want to dive into how this plays out in countries like Canada, Germany, or the US — laws and culture vary a lot.
