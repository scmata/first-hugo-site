related to why I travel

each culture has its own bias


i am black nad white or black

eyes closed/blind

we only discriminate on 


in 2000 years black is not an important word


famous add compaign, throw like a girl

dance like a black person


talking about race reinforces race

cultural exchange

between white and black is important

culture evoles naturally

this is a really good video

people are attracted to similarity

it would be interesting to talk to some of those people who come on small boats and stay in hotels in UK. maybe they want to work?
