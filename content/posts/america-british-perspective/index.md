9 months ago, I departed Heathrow airport for a nine-hour flight across the Atlantic, landing in New Jersey to begin my final year of undergraduate education. This essay attempts to capture what it truly feels like to live in America—not the textbook descriptions or AI-generated summaries, but the lived experience of cultural immersion. I will go over lots of ideals I think are fundamental to the American experience, while interleaving my own stories.

Travelling to a country I had never visited—but somehow already knew—was a strange sensation. I knew it was western so it couldn't vary too much from the UK. But also because of Hollywood, global brands, music and more, America occupies an large role in the British popular cultural experience. For instance, I had seen New York City countless times in photos and films (e.g. The Avengers), so seeing it in real life felt uncannily like déjà vu. I hadn’t fully grasped until I arrived just how powerful America’s cultural exports are—and how much of the country I had already internalised before ever setting foot there.

Still, regardless of my prior exposure or knowledge, imagining life in America before arriving could not replicate the real experience. This reminds me of the famous thought experiment of "Mary the Colour Scientist" who had studied everything about colour while confined to a black-and-white room. The key question here is that when Mary leaves the room and sees colour for the first time, she gains something. But what is that? Likewise, when travelling to a new place I don’t think any amount of reading or theoretical knowledge can replace what it feels like to really exist there, you must figure out how it feels for yourself.


## Preconceptions and First Impressions
Before arriving, my understanding of America was a patchwork of impressions: TV shows, films, the few Americans I'd met (there aren’t many at Oxford), and schoolyard stereotypes. Back in secondary school, people joked that Americans were more overweight, obsessed with guns, and overly cheerful. Kids made fun of American spelling ("color" instead of "colour") and thought of American-English as somehow simpler or less ‘proper’. Americans, we said, were louder, smiled more and much more direct.

My initial impressions confirmed the origin of my stereotypes (most stereotypes originate from some truth, even if they are wrong). 
- On food: portion sizes at places like McDonald's are similar to the UK, but the average diet does seem less healthy. Soda/fizzy drinks are sold everywhere for cheap prices-often in absurd litre sized cups. There are many more obese people, and it seems more normalised to be overweight.
- As for guns: they are definitely present in American culture, but they're not everywhere (depending on the state). You can’t openly carry them near federal buildings or densely populated areas, and most students I met didn’t own one. Still, the right to bear arms is important, for exmaple because the Second Amendment symbolizes how America secured its independence through armed resistance.
- Americans definitely smile more. On average they're more upbeat and louder, doubly so for students in sororities and fraternities - who also sometimes seem like they share the same brain cell. And yes, everything is bigger: houses, cars.. everything.

Lastly, on communication styles: Americans do tend to be more direct and emotionally open. I remember the President Eisgruber’s welcome speech to new Princeton students—his language was simple and clear, but still intelligent. One of the biggest changes I needed to make here was in humour, the sarcasm and wittiness I was used to often weren't understood completely. Furthermore, British humour in general tends to involve teasing and “banter,” often at your own or your friends’ expense, whereas in the U.S. it can be misinterpreted as genuine rudeness.

Beyond these simple points, in the rest of my time there I would like to think I got a somewhat good understanding of American culture. However, it is very important to note that my experiences are shaped by my experiences primarily interacting with Princeton University students. Not only that, America is incredibly diverse - and while summarising a population of 300 million into 3000 words I will have to summarise and construct averages and general trends from which individuals will differ wildly.

Furthermore, one thing I learnt is that the different states can be very diverse (as much as you can be without becoming a different country), hence while they might all stick to the American theme, they will all be unique in their own way. For example, some areas that stood out to me was: The South, Texas, California, Florida, New Jersey, Chicago, the Midwest and New York. 

# Economic Liberty 

{{< figure src="finance.png" caption="The financial district. New York City." width="600">}}

I think economic liberty and the free market are one of the defining characteristics of America. In summary, I would say that America has greater opportunities but deeper pitfalls. In order words, you can benefit or suffer from either side of the income inequality- near the top you can become very wealthy, but if not there’s less of a safety net to catch you compared to most of Europe. On the other side of this, the American Dream tells you that if you work hard enough and pick yourself up by the bootstraps you can work your way up the financial ladder-however I think this can be misleading.

The clear benefit of this focus on economic gain is that the USA is the wealthiest nation in the world. This allows you much more influence. Furthermore, since money is much more important here, the society is more structured around making money and spending money. From my experience, I would say people network and share their career insights more on average, and are more entrepreneurial. Furthermore, my peers in American university are more knowledgeable about the economic value of their skills and potential. In some regards because there is a need to because there is no safety net waiting to catch them, instead they must earn a living to have a good life and pay off their student loans. This is a contrast to the growing skills gap in the UK, where people earn an education that is not suited to the skills employers need.

However, having a bigger economy is not all positive. I think that people define themselves around their working lives much more here. In general, it’s live to work instead of work to live and this can propogate to extremes like hustle culture (e.g. in Princeton I think people had a desire to seem busy). People are even more economically minded around their hobbies too, for example thinking about creating a side hustle. And frankly, some aspects of the job market are absurd, like second year students applying for internships 18 months in advance with little knowledge of the workforce. Although 9am-9pm 6 days a week is not a thing here, people do get less holidays and time off work compared to the UK. Essentially, since the country is economically liberal, money is more important to people’s livelihood because basic access to life is not guaranteed. For example, healthcare is not public and university costs much more money.

Connected to this prioritization of gaining capital is a lack of social safety nets-tied to an emphasis of private industry over public one. As I mentioned, healthcare is private. While America has some of the most advanced medical technology in the world, the levels of healthcare available to different people vary wildly. Hence, average life expectancy is lower than most of Europe and obesity rates are still very high. Worker’s rights and safety laws are also worse in the US, for example the UK has protection against unfair dismissal while the US does not. Even the minimum wage does not apply to everyone, since waiters have a lower minimum wage which they need to make up in tips. (It's also worth nothing some of these factors vary by state, for example federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour while it is $16.50 in California).

### Meritocracy and the American Dream
The American Dream is a nice idea if it were true (alongside a complete meritocracy). While I think such dreams can be nice because they give people hope and motivation to work harder, they can also be damaging because they give a false impression of the realities of life, since while the only thing they can control is hard work, if then people who fail were not unlucky, they simply did not work hard enough when this is not true.

While the US is definitely not completely meritocratic, I think it is a good ideal to have as long as people aren’t blindly believing in it and can acknowledge the gaps in the meritocracy to help improve them. Compared to other countries, I think the US is meritocratic in some ways too. For example, I think information is generally more open in America about work and how to get ahead, although sometimes this can fall in the trap of signalling. More pertinently, America does not have much conception of class. Everyone has the same rights, however in practice not everyone has the same access to opportunity.[^opportunity] Wealth appears to be the main component of hierarchy in American culture, although historically and now, factors like sex and race have also been important. There are no kings or queens, and not much conception of class or aristocracy. If you are born an American citizen, you could in theory get to any role in society, whereas in the UK you cannot be born royalty. There is no automatic defference to king or queens.

However, it is important to note the many ways America is not meritocratic. For example, at Ivy leagues because of grade inflation it is easier to get an A than at some community colleges-however Ivy league universities get many more opportunities with less effort for the same grades. Furthermore, the fact that admissions are more likely to accept legacy students, and places are essentially guaranteed if you donate enough money to create a building is not fair or based on the aptitude of applicants.[^legacy]

Additionally, people who own assets generally have to work less hard and pay less taxes than someone who works for an income, since capital gains tax is much lower. Making it above a certain level of wealth makes your life easier. For example, Warren Buffet is famously quoted to have said that he pays less tax than his secretary.[^buffett] And also, the more wealth you have the more power you have, which makes it easier to accrue more power and wealth. For instance, large corporations can lobby governments to shape laws in their favor—Disney, for example, has lobbied to extend copyright protections to keep exclusive rights to characters like Mickey Mouse. Wealth also gives you access to legal power - suing is a bigger culture here and wealth gives you access to better lawyers. On the other hand, it costs more to be poorer[^poverty1] [^poverty2] and those with less wealth are more financially vulnerable. They face limited access to quality education, are often charged higher interest rates, and if you dare to be unlucky by having an accident or getting sick, poorer worker place rights and expensive healthcare means it can lead to lifelong financial ruin.

Overall, I think if I was thinking about coming to America, I would be a lot more easily convinced as a highly skilled immigrant, because I could benefit from the positive feedback loop of wealth to become very wealthy. Additionally, several skilled jobs such as medicine, engineering and finance pay more in the USA, even though cost of living is much higher in some US cities. However, if I was less skilled, I would have more pause for thought because of the lack of social safety net. However, the access to such a big economy is still beneficial-it is easier to grow in a big and growing economy compared to a stagnant or shrinking one. And the UK economy has been pretty stagnant since 2008.

[^legacy]: Slightly unfair admissions can make sense from the universities point of view. For example, if a small minority of students pay incredible amounts of money to attend the school, it will probably benefit the students overall compared to the minority of students who miss out. Still not fair, but more realistic.

    Interestingly, Oxford differs from Princeton in that it prioritises equal opportunity more. Although, I think they optimise for academic output and thinking more than power and business creation that Princeton is more algined with. Hence, the admissions criteria seem to align with the instituion as a whole.


[^opportunity]: There are several factors that affect your opportunities from the moment you are born. These include factors such as your state, city, race, sex, wealth, family culture and connections. There are even other partially genetic factors like attractiveness or intelligence

# Personal Liberty

{{< figure src="statue_liberty.png" caption="The statue of liberty" width="600">}}

Individual liberty stands as one of America's core principle, much as civic duty defined Romans or rationality defined Greeks. It's emphasised in the 
Declaration of Independence supporting "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". It also affects the structure of government-after gaining independence from the UK, America did not want a higher power to be able to take control, and structured its government to prevent excessive state control over personal liberties through the Bill of Rights and constitutional checks and balances.[^bill_rights] Furthermore, a lot of political arguments are framed as discussions over liberty such as in speech, body, guns and health.[^freedom1] Even one of America’s most famous landmarks is called the Statue of Liberty.

Honestly, you can feel it when you enter the country. I felt free to express myself and in particular free from judgement. This was a refreshing departure from the collectivistic mindset that it is bad to stand out which exists in some countries like the UK (colloquially called a "crabs in a bucket" mentality). Instead, in America it is almost a good thing to stand out- because you can turn your unique features into strengths. (Although not everywhere in America is free from collectivistic thinking-you can still be held back in places). 

One side effect of this focus on individualism is American’s are better at selling themselves. Marketing yourself is also generally an important skill for progressing in an economy. I think this is a good thing overall, as long as it doesn’t stray into the trap of signalling or exaggeration, which I think people sometimes could come close too. One funny example is Instagram photos: I’ve met a lot more men here who actually pose in Instagram photos and people seem slightly less shy to make images of themselves, whereas in UK I would say that putting too much effort into your appearance can make you seem inauthentic, vain or cringe, instead more candid photos are preferred.


Furthermore, free speech is protected in America to a greater level compared to the UK.[^free_speech] While in general you're expected the core American values of a liberal economy, beyond that you're more or less free to form your own idealogy. And even if you don't like democracy or free markets, you can still talk about it. It's funny, while travelling around and meeting some people they will even give you their own catchphrases when you say goodbye.

[^free_speech]: [The Conversation- An interesting article about free speech not being a right in the UK](https://theconversation.com/official-secrets-act-home-secretarys-planned-reform-will-make-criminals-out-of-journalists-164890)


[^bill_rights]: The Federal system makes it harder for any one party to quickly take control and change a lot of laws because of the different layers. However, this also makes it harder to implement schemes on a federal level for social support.

[^freedom1]: Speculative thoughts: An interesting thing to read into would be how Americans define liberty. It's a common philosophical point that in a society no person can be completely free, becuase that would impinge on the liberties of others. Hence, how do you define what is part of the private domain and what is public. After travelling in other countries where personal freedom is thought to be less of a priority, I wonder how much more free people in the West actually are, becuase the state might not get involved but the community will, especially with cancel culture.

# Idealism

{{< figure src="eagle_flag.png" caption="A bald eagle carrying the American flag (not real)" width="600">}}

Another aspect of American culture is that they love ideals (such as individual liberty). They love grand ideals and images, sometimes the bigger the better. Similarly to the ideal of the American dream, I think these ideals can have good and bad consequences. It is important to have values, but also to recognise that they might be difficult to implement in practice and in what ways reality differs from those ideals. Writing this, I realised the modern idea of superheroes and comic books which originated in America symbolise this quite well. I mean, they literally have a character called "Captain America".


This is more speculative, but it almost feels like it easier for America to have ideals because they are such a new country-they don’t have centuries of baggage and tradition to sort out. However, in this vein sometimes it feels like Americans are always searching for new traditions to define them -they have to almost consciously come up with them more than them emerging. People want to clasp onto labels like Italian American or Irish American, when this is already quite separate from the countries they originated from.[^traditions]

What I like about stating these ideals so directly though is that it makes it much easier to understand what the country stands for. This in turn makes it easier to know when these ideals should be adjusted or what needs to be changed if they are difficult to implement.

Furthermore, I don’t know if the core set of British values is as easy to concentrate as it is for America. In Britian in 2011 the four key British values were made to be: Democracy, Rule of Law, Respect and Tolerance, Individual Liberty as a [response to preventing terrorism](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-strategy-2011). However, I don’t know if that is enough to encapsulate the country. A YouTube video interviewing people when the British ideals were stated showed that it seems most of the general public aren't well connected to these ideals[^british_ideals]. Hence, tradition also seems to play a big role in defining British culture. (In political theory, this trade off between tradition and ideals would be called conservative nationalism vs liberal nationalism or idealism).

[^traditions]: As I've read more history, it's pretty impressive how fast time moves and a new identity for a people can emerge, since America was only founded about 300 years ago. My guess for when a new 'identity' starts forming is about 150/200 years in, when you can't really remember who your great great grandparents were.

# Diversity and immigration

(Diversity, race and immigration to me is one of the key defining features of America, and one of the most complex to the extent that people have dedcated their lives ot studying it. Given my narrow perspective through living in Princeton for a year, this was also one of the most difficult sections for me to write and the one where my opinion and knowledge is still updating. I now can see a lot of issues that fundamentally (to my eyes) stem from America's colonial history, where I didn't make this connection before.)

America is one of the most diverse countries in the world, particularly in terms of culture by being constituted of a mix of cultures from all over the world. Additionally, America was built on a history of immigrants and slavery. This history is quite complex, involving Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, African Americans among others-however it’s interesting that many [English Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Americans) don’t claim that title. The original Americans-native Americans are not a dominant force in the country now, going from 100% of the population in the 1600s to under 3$. Hence, understanding colonialism is necessary to understand how the American people came to be today.

From a demographic perspective, in the UK we have lots of immigrants from Asia and Africa, however in America they have those plus immigrants from South America and more Jewish people, though I would say they have less Arabic immigrants. Overall, 60% of the USA is white while 80% of the UK is. And like most places, a lot of the diversity is in the cities for both countries.

In my opinion, diversity is one of America’s strengths. Because it has historically accepted so many immigrants, it is able to get perspectives of life from all over the world to benefit the country. For a highly skilled worker, I think it is one of the most attractive countries to move to and it is easier compared to other countries because many diasporas already exist there, so it is more likely you can find a community from your own country as well as the general population being more aware of different cultures. Many countries suffer from brain drain, and I think America is always a country for consideration for immigrants-I don’t have any figures but I assume it gets a lot from “brain gain”.

Another thing that makes it easier to immigrate to America is that I think it is much easier to become or feel “American” than with any other nationality, which can maybe be related back to it having less deep set traditions and more clear ideals. Within a couple years I think many people could culturally identify as American, however, an American coming to the UK would have a much longer and harder time becoming British I think. Even for me moving from Ireland to the UK, it was a struggle at times. Government and public policy may not seem to represent this in America especially with ICE, but thinking comparatively I don't know any government that has a completely friendly attitude towards immigrants.

In my opinion, America will grow as a leader in managing an array of different cultures. In some countries like South Korea, many people haven’t even met a black person before. For the average American, having to grow up around different cultures automatically makes you more aware and more tolerant. There are also some terms like cultural appropriation due to cultural conflict that originated in America, and it seems more study goes towards studying culture there. However, while it is easier to feel American because of less deep-set traditions and because it is a bigger melting pot of different cultures, it often feels like these ingredients clump together in different groups rather than mix to form a homogenous whole. Nevertheless, as other developed nations become more diverse and face similar challenges, I think there will be a lot of lessons to learn from America.

## Race, culture and social inequaluty

[link the interviewing black and white people in the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4uZp9Cr-UM&pp=ygUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3aW5nIHdoaXRlIGFuZCBibGFjayBwZW9wbGUgaW4gdGhlIHVr)

However, while America is very diverse the story is not all positive. There has been a long history of racial and sexual discrimination.[^malcolm] The profit and exploitation from colonialism also forms a foundation of their origin as a nation-state. On the racial side, there are also remnants of racial inequalities that remain in the system, for example redlining and segregation laws marked Black neighborhoods as high risk for investment. For example, there are still lower quality schools in many predominantly black areas and food apartheid means that marginalized communities have worse access to healthy food. Socially, many tensions still exist too-for example this is thought to be a bigger issue in the South.

Comparing back to the UK, in my mind race is not as big an issue in people's mind compared to class, and while racism still exists it is generally more subtle and less present as an issue in people's minds. I think class is something most American's don't relate to, for example posh is not an intuitive concept for most Americans: some will still have implicit social biases, such as how many people really liked my English accent, that could be related to class[^colonial1]. Since class does not exist in the same way, wealth appears a clearer division of inequality as well as the division between those colonised and colonisers in America history. An example of the differentiation, is that in the 1945 British play Inspector Calls, the self-made businessman Arthur Birling would not be insecure about his working class background if he was in America because people would not care-however while he is a successful businessman in the UK, it does not give him the same social standing as those born into aristocracy. While formal aristocratic barriers don’t exist in the UK, class divisions are still felt in people, and people care a lot if they are perceived as upper, middle or working class. Class is determined from aspects among family background, accent and education. Public schools associated with the upper class are known as the most exclusive and prestigious schools in the UK. These schools send proportionally more students to top universities like Oxford, where [all recent British prime ministers have studied](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37500542). Unfortunately, along with class inequality many British people do not question such systems, and it seems they feel they must belong in a certain place in society compared to America which champions the idea of social mobility more. This happens to the extent that others are looked down upon by trying to change their class, although it is a complicated issue - upper class people tend to pretend to be upper middle class to improve their appearance. 

While in America social mobility is discussed more, so is race as a concept and issue - to the point where it pervades many parts of life. My example here is dating: before I came to America I never put a lot of thought about what race the person I was dating was from-maybe country but not race. However, dating outside of your race appeared to be a much bigger thing and sometimes taboo in America- for example whenever I heard of a black person dating a white person in Princeton it always was made to seem like a big deal in terms of people’s reactions. 

While my experience of race and culture in America was mainly through the lens of being black or white, there are many other cultures such as South Asian, East Asian and Latino cultures that I was not as closely integrated into.

There also exists very distinct black and white cultures in the USA, potentially more than in the UK. There are also many more black people in America (14%) compared to the UK (4%). In the UK, desi people make up more of the population and have more distinct presence, for example-South Asians constitute 7.5% of the UK population and one of the recent prime ministers was of Indian descent.

Furthermore, in America there is definitely a distinctive black and white culture. So much so, I think a blind person can probably tell the difference between cultures thought of as black and white. Differences can exist in food, music and even language with African American Vernacular English.


The idea of how we label race is also interesting. In Britian recently the term BAME, Black Asian Minority Ethnic has become more popular. Black people specifically are more tied to their country of origin, so there is not much concept of African Britons-people are usually African and British. However, in America there is a clear separation between African Americans and Africans.

Within Princeton, I felt much more motivation to identify as a black individual. The black communities on campus were incredibly supportive to me and each other and made a big impact on my time there. However, this led to some mixed feelings for me, becuase I felt a kinship to people solely based on my skin colour, which I had not felt to such an extent before. I began to question - why did I not feel kinship to others in the same way?

In Princeton, it did seem that different racial groups tended to cluster together and form friendship groups within themselves. Even some Princeton eating clubs (similar to fraternities) had different majority races. For me, it seems that the more we reinforce these black and white spaces, the bigger the divide between them will be. I think the way forward would be to acknowledge the existing black and white cultural differences and their own cultural positives and artefacts and to try and share between them. In the future, I hope race is not as big of a divider among people as it is now-and instead helps bring people together.


[^malcolm]: (I would recommend reading the Autobiography of Malcolm X to see how wildly different things were not long ago)

[^colonial1]: Or rather potenitally colonial history that placed Britishness near the top of the social heirarchy.



[^footnote_origin_word_black]: While I could say the white community was not as well connected explicitly or supportive, that is may because it is the “default” race in America, so it does not need extra support. The words “White American” are not used and interestingly, the idea of white could have started as a way to create an in-group separate from black people and other ethnic minorities.


# Patriotism-America at the center of the world
https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-playing-national-anthem-before-sporting-events-patriotism-mark-cuban-2021-2
* I have literally had a friend say “America is the best country in the world”. 

The Olympic take thing from noah lyles

America is a very patriotic country. This can be seen in many scenarios. In schools people ledge allegiance to the flag every morning, the national anthem is required to be played before all major sporing games (unlike the Premier League in the UK), and veterans are highly regarded for serving their country. Seeing the American Flag is also very common around America.

I think it is easy to think of America as a great country. I think one factor for this is that the country is massive. For example, Boston is the 25th biggest city in the UK, ad the skyscrapers are easily bigger than those in London.  There is also a lot of diversity in terms of states and cities, and you can probably find what you want in terms of vibe. The geographical diversity of the USA is also beautiful with lots of national parks and in general the country can be self sufficient due to a large availability of natural resources. Since America is a well-developed and wealthy nation and has a diverse population, I think this means few people few people a have strong motivation to leave or emigrate.

However, with this patriotism I think it is important for Americans to remain humble and conscientious of other countries. It’s hard to describe, but while travelling around you definitely do not feel like you’re going to a different country when going to a different state. I think one of the most obvious examples is architecture- it is largely very similar in different American cities. Because America is so big, there are not many countries Americans can easily travel to because they would require a long and expensive flight-hence trips to Europe and beyond are typically reserved for the wealthier. This is why I’m grateful for the diversity and accessibility to travel in Europe. However, the US is known for having worse world geography (I once had a Spanish friend be asked if Spain was in Mexico while introducing herself).
I think it is easy for America to feel on top, because it has been for most of recent history. But there is value in remaining humble because we don’t know how the future will play out, and America was founded on a foundation of international migrants.

# Friendliness
I’ve also heard American highschools can be more cliquey.

Americans are also generally more friendly. The example I typically use is elevators/lifts. In America most people will hold the lift open for you while in the UK people will watch it close as they see you 7 metres away. In New York, people can start conversations with people next to them and it’s normal. However, in the UK smiling at someone in London can be weird-people generally stay in their own lanes more.

I think these are two ends almost on a friendliness spectrum. Coming to the US, I realised it was slightly harder to figure out who actually liked you because everyone is so good at small talk. In the UK, it’s easier to tell who likes you because they’ll make an effort to talk to you, if they don’t like you they generally won’t talk to you much. And American people are slightly more likely to invite you to their friends and make an effort to host you.
Britian also has the stiff upper lip and has a habit of not saying exactly what they mean. There’s a culture of not being rude by being too direct, so you must diminish the strength of your comments. American people in contrasts are more direct. I would say both countries have similar levels of emotional openness though.

# Conservatism
While I have talked about how liberal America is, it’s odd to say a lot of people’s beliefs are actually quite conservative. People are much more religious here than in the UK. European or gay thing. Less open to homosexuality -> straight and masculinity is also more rigid (especially in the black community).

Within Princeton people even swore much less than I was used to in the UK. The biggest thing for me was the higher drinking age – you can get married, buy a gun and sign up for military service before you can drink. It’s almost like the country is trying to shield their youth. This doesn’t always work though: in the case of drinking many youth are binge drinking in unsupervised environments instead of drinking in a public controlled environment like a pub. From the UK perspective, I do like pub culture to a degree but I can acknowledge that drinking every week is not very productive.
# The point of it all
Seeing a country from it’s own perspective. Live and breathe like an American person. Eat the same food, go to the same schools and meet the same people.
What becomes salient to you. Notes from China.
Understanding the vibe

In another life maybe I would’ve studied international relations.

In general, the black community was incredibly supportive, however this gave me some mixed thoughts because I developed a small affinity towards black people. for example, if someone was ethnically ambiguous and told me they were part black I felt an immediate kinship to them, in the same vein as if they told me they were also British for example. This was strange for me to deal with because race is a socially constructed concept, and from my heritage I was evenly half white and half black. Why then shouldn’t I have the same bond with white people? Only because I am mainly judged as black based on my skin tone?
