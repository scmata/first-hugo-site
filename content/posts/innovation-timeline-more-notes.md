# Timeline of history technologies and scientific developments


After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking
ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance eclipsed engineering as the way to
approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how
exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason
to design it concretely




Because globalization and technology are different modes of progress, it’s possible to have both,
either, or neither at the same time. For example, 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid
technological development and rapid globalization. Between the First World War and Kissinger’s
trip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much
globalization. Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological
development, mostly confined to IT.
This age of globalization has made it easy to imagine that the decades ahead will bring more
convergence and more sameness. Even our everyday language suggests we believe in a kind of
technological end of history: the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing
nations implies that the “developed” world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer
nations just need to catch up.

“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche
wrote


From the 17th century through the 1950s and ’60s, definite optimists led the Western world.
Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businessmen made the world richer, healthier, and more long-lived
than previously imaginable. As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels saw clearly, the 19th-century
business class


"created more massive and more colossal productive forces than all preceding generations
together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry
and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for
cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground—what earlier
century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?"


After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking
ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance eclipsed engineering as the way to
approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how
exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason
to design it concretely


nstead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange alreadyinvented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing
companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And
private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra
efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations. It’s no surprise that these fields all
attract disproportionate numbers of high-achieving Ivy League optionality chasers; what could be a
more appropriate reward for two decades of résumé-building than a seemingly elite, process-oriented
career that promises to “keep options open”?


Recent graduates’ parents often cheer them on the established path. The strange history of the Baby
Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel
entitled to it. Whether you were born in 1945 or 1950 or 1955, things got better every year for the
first 18 years of your life, and it had nothing to do with you. Technological advance seemed to
accelerate automatically, so the Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for
how to fulfill them. Then, when technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income
inequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers. Every year of adulthood continued to get
automatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest of their generation was left
behind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their
naïve optimism. Since tracked careers worked for them, they can’t imagine that they won’t work for
their kids, too.


Malcolm Gladwell says you can’t understand Bill Gates’s success without understanding his
fortunate personal context: he grew up in a good family, went to a private school equipped with a
computer lab, and counted Paul Allen as a childhood friend. But perhaps you can’t understand
Malcolm Gladwell without understanding his historical context as a Boomer (born in 1963). When
Baby Boomers grow up and write books to explain why one or another individual is successful, they
point to the power of a particular individual’s context as determined by chance. But they miss the
even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a whole generation learned fromchildhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning. Gladwell at first
appears to be making a contrarian critique of the myth of the self-made businessman, but actually his
own account encapsulates the conventional view of a generation.

And it’s not just the electoral process—the very character of government has become indefinite,
too. The government used to be able to coordinate complex solutions to problems like atomic
weaponry and lunar exploration. But today, after 40 years of indefinite creep, the government mainly
just provides insurance; our solutions to big problems are Medicare, Social Security, and a dizzying
array of other transfer payment programs. It’s no surprise that entitlement spending has eclipsed
discretionary spending every year since 1975. To increase discretionary spending we’d need definite
plans to solve specific problems. But according to the indefinite logic of entitlement spending, we can
make things better just by sending out more checks.


Meanwhile, probabilistic attitudes have come to shape the agenda of biology itself. In 1928,
Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming found that a mysterious antibacterial fungus had grown on a petri
dish he’d forgotten to cover in his laboratory: he discovered penicillin by accident. Scientists have
sought to harness the power of chance ever since. Modern drug discovery aims to amplify Fleming’s
serendipitous circumstances a millionfold: pharmaceutical companies search through combinations of
molecular compounds at random, hoping to find a hit.
But it’s not working as well as it used to. Despite dramatic advances over the past two centuries,
in recent decades biotechnology hasn’t met the expectations of investors—or patients. Eroom’s law—that’s Moore’s law backward—observes that the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars
spent on R&D has halved every nine years since 1950. Since information technology accelerated
faster than ever during those same years, the big question for biotech today is whether it will ever see
similar progress. Compare biotech startups to their counterparts in computer software



Long-term planning is often undervalued by our indefinite short-term world. When the first iPod
was released in October 2001, industry analysts couldn’t see much more than “a nice feature for
Macintosh users” that “doesn’t make any difference” to the rest of the world. Jobs planned the iPod to
be the first of a new generation of portable post-PC devices, but that secret was invisible to most
people. One look at the company’s stock chart shows the harvest of this multi-year plan:


1. Goals that can be satisfied with minimal effort;
2. Goals that can be satisfied with serious effort; and
3. Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes.
This is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski argued that
modern people are depressed because all the world’s hard problems have already been solved.
What’s left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying. What
you can do, even a child can do; what you can’t do, even Einstein couldn’t have done. So Kaczynski’s
idea was to destroy existing institutions, get rid of all technology, and let people start over and work
on hard problems anew


Second is risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By
definition, a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream. If your goal is to never make a mistake in
your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life
to something that no one else believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and wrong
can be unbearable.


You can’t find secrets without looking for them. Andrew Wiles demonstrated this when he proved
Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other mathematicians—the kind of
sustained failure that might have suggested an inherently impossible task. Pierre de Fermat had
conjectured in 1637 that no integers a, b, and c could satisfy the equation a
n + b
n = c
n
for any integer n
greater than 2. He claimed to have a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his conjecture long
remained a major unsolved problem in mathematics. Wiles started working on it in 1986, but he kept
it a secret until 1993, when he knew he was nearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles
proved the conjecture in 1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets.
If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets
is an effective truth.
The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless
searchers. There is more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and in technology of all kinds. We
are within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today’s conventional
disciplines, but of ambitions so great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution
hesitated to announce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and
metabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world from conflict over
fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we
can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers. But we will never learn any of these
secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look


Robert Boyle (1661) emphasized experimental rigor in The Sceptical Chymist, separating chemistry from alchemy.

Lavoisier (late 1700s) introduced the law of conservation of mass, debunked the “phlogiston” theory, and established quantitative chemistry.

Mendeleev’s periodic table (1869) organized elements by atomic weight, revealing hidden patterns and predicting undiscovered elements.

🧪 3. The Industrial & Pharmaceutical Boom (1800s–1950s)
Organic chemistry exploded: dyes, explosives, synthetic rubber, plastics, and fuels.

The 20th century brought synthetic drugs (aspirin, penicillin, insulin), petrochemicals, and polymers (nylon, Teflon).

WWII accelerated chemical innovation — for both medicine and weapons (e.g. mustard gas, napalm).

⚠️ Chemistry became hugely powerful, but increasingly institutionalized and tied to government and industry.



1944 – Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty show DNA carries genetic information.

1953 – Watson & Crick discover the double helix structure of DNA (with major input from Rosalind Franklin).

1960s – The genetic code is cracked; we learn how DNA is translated into proteins via RNA.

1970s – Discovery of restriction enzymes and recombinant DNA enables the rise of genetic engineering.
