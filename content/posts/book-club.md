📖!!!!!ELS Book Club!!!!!📖

Hi everyone! At the end of the weekend I mentioned starting a book club. I feel like everyone wants to read more and it is incredibly useful to learn new things in a way that conversations or youtube videos can't do because they offer more depth and time with a topic. Hence, I think this would be a nice opportunity to have some accountability while letting people get to know each other more as we share stories and experiences about how we interpret and relate to different parts of the books.

My vision for this right now is our group choosing a book to read each month. I imagine as people make their way through it people will be messaging about their favourite sections or chapters etc more informally. But also officially we can have a call/meeting every month at a consistent day to discuss the book and talk about ideas for the next one.

Stay tuned for the first book I choose! But first I would like to get some suggestions and a gauge of interest from you all! So please fill out the google form if you are interested!!! (But also please take a second to think about whether you want to actually commit to reading).

Based on interests we can even maybe do 2 groups with separate books at the same time. Once responses come in I'll have more of a think about the best way to choose books each month.

To give you a bit of an initial vibe of what I'm interested in, here are some suggestions (the general theme seems to be learning about interesting areas I haven't been exposed to formally with an engineering background):
- Entrepreneurship: Shoe dog, zero to one
- Leadership: memoirs of nelson mandela, richard branson
- Business/economics: lowkey looking for resources, I just got recommended "A little History of Economics" but before I used textbooks which aren't as easily readable and much less book club friendly
- Life skills/communication and influence: never split the difference (negotiating), Made To Stick (how to package an idea so that it spreads and is easily memorable) 
- Global awareness/history and politics: Guns, germs and steel, sapiens, ian morris works
- Life perspective: pathless path, the defining decade, man's search for meaning

(One personal note is that I prefer to disucss books that are quality/have a clear message e.g. there's a bunch of books on leadership that are waffle/vague)

But put any and all areas you would be interested in discussing further with this group. The deadline for the form is next Friday 17/10, and I'll be in touch with everyone after that!


TLDR (ironic): If you're interested in joining a book club with the ELS community fill out this form by next friday


Reflecting on my recent reading, the general theme for me is mainly interesting areas for learning about areas I don't usually have as much access to from an engineering background.
For me this includes:







MY interests are entrepreneurship


Read a book per month and meet to discuss it. Although I imagien people will be hopefully sending messages as they make their way through it and 

People are free to discuss it in whatsapp etc as they get th



nd to stimulate discussion about our experiences and growth journeys.
