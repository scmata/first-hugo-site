# Is all the low hanging fruit gone in technolgy development

As an engineering graduate, it’s easy to think the “low-hanging fruit” of technology has already been picked. The scientific revolutions of the past—mastering physics, chemistry, and biology—gave us nuclear power, plastics, and antibiotics. Back then, inventing calculus could change the course of history; today, mastering it is merely a graduation requirement.

Yet the opportunities for innovation are far from over-although we may need to look for them in other areas. In fact, the pace of technological change is accelerating. The real challenge now is not just to invent, but to guide our inventions—to steer them toward a future that benefits humanity rather than harms it.

This article will go over a brief history of innovation and ideas to encourage it and nature it.

## An explosion in progress after the scientific revolution

We have a lot to thank for our current progress for the scientific revolution which happened in the 1600s. This  
created a culture of beliving in science rather than religion. For the first time, we could answer fundamental questions about our existence through modelling and experiment. Fruthermore, the printing press helped spread these ideas widely. 

Then from the 1800s, there seemed to be an explostion in technology. The industrial revolution kicked off in Britian with the steam engine, then we had electricity leading to the computer and the internet, we also had chemistry innovation discovering the period table, physics innovation discovering special and general relativity, as well as developign nuclear technology. In biology we had germ theory and vaccines.

Basic science of biology, physics and chemistry. 

Accomponied with all this change, we were becoming masters of the world. We saw that through applying our knowledge of the natural laws, we could manipulate our environments to suit our nature. As such, we chased loftier and bigger goals. 
In 1843, the London
public was invited to make its first crossing underneath the River Thames by a newly dug tunnel. In
1869, the Suez Canal saved Eurasian shipping traffic from rounding the Cape of Good Hope. In 1914
the Panama Canal cut short the route from Atlantic to Pacific. Even the Great Depression failed to
impede relentless progress in the United States, which has always been home to the world’s most farseeing definite optimists. The Empire State Building was started in 1929 and finished in 1931. The
Golden Gate Bridge was started in 1933 and completed in 1937. The Manhattan Project was started
in 1941 and had already produced the world’s first nuclear bomb by 1945. Americans continued to
remake the face of the world in peacetime: the Interstate Highway System began construction in 1956,
and the first 20,000 miles of road were open for driving by 1965. Definite planning even went beyond
the surface of this planet: NASA’s Apollo Program began in 1961 and put 12 men on the moon before
it finished in 1972.

However, the last 30 years haven't quite felt the same in the West. The mature industries based on advances in basic science were drying up and becoming institionalised. As such, you weren't going to be able to change the world by following in the footsteps of the people you heard about in your science lessons - the world is moving on. Now, the innovation you can earn the most money from is in the internet and information technology or "tech" (and recently AI-which may be our next printing press in terms of accelerating innovation). We also have various deep tech ventures, and stuff like CRISPR.

It does feel harder to truly transform people's lives. And people are healthier than ever- malnutrition isn't a problem. Haber process means that we can extract much mroe energy from plants. Each person is getting closer to optimum of living to old age. And even athletics records are slowing down. This idea of us having finished developing even ties into our vocabulary - Peter Thiel says 'the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing
nations implies that the “developed” world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer
nations just need to catch up.'

However this isn't true, and we can realise that by zooming out.
## Looking at development on a wider scope

Measuring the development of humanity on a long term scope is not the easiest question to define, but the easiest method is with the economy. This is the graph, it grows a lot. In the short term this growth will keep going. Therefore, having intention about where we put our innovation is more important than ever.

This means that we need the right mindset around innovation too by teaching people about the shape of innovation. We need to educate people about the frontiers of innovation. Universities do a good job, but I think the link between research and spin outs could be strengthend. This is hard, because as technology gets more advanced it takes longer to teach people to understand it to build upon it.

There are some basic steps for innovation.
- Grand visions are necessary
- New technologies won't be made from incremental improvements
- A plan with long term dedication (at least 5 years is necessary)

To be able to actually implement these guidelines it is important to have the right frameworks too. The first step should be understanding the shape of innovation, ideally in general, but at least in one field. The most surface area right now is in tech related ventures - however, if you have education in a more instutitonalised field - think about how you can use those skills in growing fields. Often they're very ripe for crossover e.g. physics to economics or statistics to other scientists. Then also be aware if you're actually producing innovation or globalisation. If you're providing profit by figuring out how to do A/B tests or making money in finance, maybe not the best idea. The unfortunate reality is that investment in new basic science may lead to discoveries that you do not personally benefit much from.





































- If you want to be on the frontiers be in tech ( less likely to do it in engineering).
- Try and be aware of if you're actually producing innovation or globalisation. If you're providing profit by figuring out how to do A/B tests or making money in finance, maybe not the best idea.
- Investing in under explored basic science is probabably useful, just maybe not in your lifetime.
- If you have education in a more instutitonalised field - think about how you can use those skills in growing fields. Often they're very ripe for crossover e.g. physics to economics or statistics to other scientists


Instead of 
Energy and information.




Lastly, to be able to implement these guidelines you need a good understanding of the shape of technology right now. It is clear economically that most technology has been driven by information technology or "tech" in the last 30 years. Deep tech hopes to channel some of that. The low hanging fruit are not gone, but we won't get there by chasing up the same trees.







While it does appear there was a step change around 1815 because of cultural evolution and the printing press, innovation has been core to human advancement. However, not all technology will directly lead to human benefit e.g. the printing press. Making tools is essential to humanity - the ostrich analogy from founders podcast.

Explaining the massive growth is not easy, but appears to be tied to cultural evolution and printing press. Also
The scientific revolution in the 1600s led a transition from natural philosophy and knowledge from authority to empiritical observation, experimentaiton and mathemtical description including the scientific method. Furthermore, the spread of the printing press allowed knowledge to spread unlike ever before.

Since then we've seen a massive gain in innovation through engineering. Although while this did exist before (e.g. eygptians using pythagoreas to mark land, mathematics) and also stuff like the printing press, and fire, controlled use of fire, and impressive civil architecture, I think this shift in thinking laid a big foundation for the highly explosive growth from 1815 to 1971, including the invention of the computer, the discovery of germ theory, the steam engine and electricity.


Scientific revolution was a change in culture, before explanations often relied on superstition, religion, or myths. After, natural phenomena were explained through natural laws that could be discovered and tested.
