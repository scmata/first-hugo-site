AI can't believe in things. It can't wrestle with a topic.

AI has no conception of growth/learning more
 and god etc./progress


what does it mean to live a good life? what is good? does god exist? 

simon sinek-getting to conclusion is not the answer

use AI to enhance your processes, not your end result

AI doctors can't take over that easily -> who will understand it/who is responsible.

e.g. physics as a science of modelling, doesnt make sense if you cant understand and use the model.
insights

There's a lot more to cognition than just language (people withotu language still have lots of cognitive abilitiy - however it seems language is what separates us from other species)

tacit knowledge

this will probably be outdated in two years.

we evolved to live in an ecosystem -> if AI learns to develop then

john fish on reading is not for productivity

the value of human effort

what if it breaks? e.g. learning, or what if it doesnt and is consistently better than you at e.g. consulting
