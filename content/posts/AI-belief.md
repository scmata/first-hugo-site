AI can't believe in things. It can't wrestle with a topic.

what does it mean to live a good life? what is good? does god exist? 

simon sinek-getting to conclusion is not the answer

use AI to enhance your processes, not your end result

AI doctors can't take over that easily -> who will understand it/who is responsible.

e.g. physics as a science of modelling, doesnt make sense if you cant understand and use the model.
insights

There's a lot more to cognition than just language (people withotu language still have lots of cognitive abilitiy - however it seems language is what separates us from other species)

tacit knowledge

this will probably be outdated in two years.

we evolved to live in an ecosystem -> if AI learns to develop then
