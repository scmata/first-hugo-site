## What actually is data science?

Machine learning and AI have become hugely popular buzz words - furthermore, it may be a field you have skill in becuase of interest or bla bla bla.

But what do you actually do? And more importantly - why is it useful?

A company only hires you for one reason - becuase the ROI of paying you is greater than the increased profit you will produce. For some roles, the link is obvious - marketing and sales leads to more customers, customer support increases the lifetime value of a customer by keeping them more loyal, engineering results in more products. But what does a data scientist do? The term is now used in so many places it has become unclear.

Furthermore, any large company that doesn't use data to drive it's decisions is ultimately doomed to be out competed by those that do with higher effieincy. Thus, more roles in companies are finding a need for at least some level of data skills.

Just having data is not a magic tool, 


it hasn't been around for a long time

with somebody with knowledge, it is obvious that data driven decision making is useful

#### What is data science?/ how data scientists create

Simply put, data science is "solving business problems using data." It uses the skills of science and statistics (machine learning is essentially automated statistics) to create value. While these analysis skills are very useful, they are completely useless in the abstract. When analysing a dataset, one thing that quickly becomes apparent is that a certain amount of domain knowledge is necessary. Typically, this domain knowledge can either be primarly related to business operation or the product that the business makes.

Lyft summarises this well in their job roles: 

> Data Scientist, Decisions: “Data Science for Humans”
> Decisions Data Scientists influence decisions made by executives, product managers, engineers, ops/business teams, and other stakeholders. They utilize a deep understanding of the business to develop decision frameworks that drive alignment on the most impactful problems and solutions.

> Data Scientist, Algorithms: “Data Science for Machines”
> Algorithms Data Scientists develop models that power internal and external production systems. They typically apply a combination of optimization, machine learning, and inference methods to design, improve, and monitor models and systems.

On the business side, you can build models of factors relevant to the business such as forecasting sales, or clustering different customers and using it to predict customer churn. You can think of this as an advanced data analyst.

On the product side, the potential domains you may work in are essentially as broad as the number of businesses in existence. This can be from machine learning for biomedical engineering, to extract features from EEG recordings, to finance and predicting the stock market, to dating apps suggesting new people to match with and social media algorithm design to suggest new people to date. These can be internal or external products, e.g. fraud detection and algorithmic trading or recommendation algorithm.

These roles can be more or less 'research' heavy (or with a need to understand the underlying algorithms). Applied scientists e.g. STT are working with people on the fronteir of deep learning help turn cutting edge research into marketable products, whereas a machine learning engineer may be implementing linear regression for important use case with MLFlow/automl. As you can already tell, a lot of these use cases require skills that blend into each other. Here are all the roles that might appear

Limitation of data for humans:
- wisdom/first principle thinking

FOunders podcast, jeff bezos doesn't hire consultant, use first principle thinking instead
- the other guy who said if he wanted to make sure his competitors didnt grow he would give them experts, e.g. chicken finger dream telling him that he's not following health trends with mcdonalds


#### Typical data science archetype

better at software than staticisian, better at stats than software. knows python but won't put their code into production

(add funny thing about worse at stats than staticisian)

Commonly comes out of a science program.

The issue with this is that you will find few places that actually find these skills directly useful, mainly big companies designing AI models, or other companies like finance companies with advanced forecasting software. You need either more domain knowledge or better skills in general to be useful to most companies.

coming out of academic environment
data science for humans/machines
learning how to put models into production
working with big data
communicating with stakeholders
(and other general business skills like working in a team and presentation skills)


focus on algorithm development. All the other skills will have to be used too.
- developing a better understanding of how ML algorithms work to be able to improve them (although this is a bit of alchemy as well as chemistry)


industry relevant skills, in the same way a CS grad who has coded a few things in class also needs to work on skills

easier to change when more junior, but when more senior you have more experience in a given type of data poentially? importanc eof domain knowledge too. useufl chatGPT message

## A taxonomy of data jobs

All the relevant roles:

- Data analyst
- Data engineer (data infrastrucre)
- Machine learning engineer (ML models)
- Research scientist (Research Scientists are more focused on creating new scientific knowledge and exploring novel ideas.)
- Applied scientist (Applied Scientists are about taking those ideas and making them work in real-world scenarios to deliver value. )
    The job of an applied scientist is not to do cutting edge research, but to help turn cutting edge research into marketable products. Towards the D end of R and Ds
- Research engineer
- Data scientist (knows python)
- ML Ops

Realistically, data science could be made to fit any of these descriptions, so it is ore useful in my opinion to use these labels.

#### big data

Big data is when you need to use distributed systems instead of data warehousing. All companies provide data.

Add in bit about foundation models making domain knowledge potentially less important?

Although language models are good at language, typically they still require someone to understand the domain to understand what a good output looks like. E.g. training an LLM to summarise podcasts or generate copy, or even generate a website


#### The value chain of data


data science for humans
Data analyst (usually around first 10 hires in a company)  lift?

Data engineer (Works on keeping data in order to make analysis more easy)

Data scientist (Advanced analysis that the data analysts can't do - usually their basic skills are in SQL and stuff)
 - although making an API and stuff could be data science things



Separate -> data science for machines
- fundamental roles: software engineer (models in production)
(D of R and D?)
- next step: machine learning engineer on applied side (apply known models)
- machine learning engineer on applied theory side, thinking of new model

At these stages, generally prefer hiring someone with prior domain expertise, but the higher up the chain you go- the easier it is to hire someone with advanced data science skills than train someone with those skills.

- research scientist/data scientist typically only 

e.g. LLM research easier to relate

super powers

same tools can actually be used in both. Risk of big data is foundation models broadly applied, but you need ot convince exectuvies that the models are useful and communicate the usefulness -> domain knowledge still important.

#### The playbook for data scientists

There is no playbook, open ended analysis. Each case is different. E.g. science and business. There will be a lot of crossover though in analysis and tools and skills

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   Before analysis begins, data scientists gather data from various sources like databases, APIs, or even sensor devices. However, real-world data is often messy — filled with errors, missing values, or inconsistencies. Cleaning and organizing this data is a crucial first step.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
   Exploratory data analysis helps understand the underlying patterns or anomalies in the data. Data scientists use visual tools like charts, graphs, and dashboards to make sense of the information and communicate findings effectively.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning**
   Applying statistical models or machine learning algorithms enables data scientists to identify relationships, classify information, cluster similar data points, or predict outcomes. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, allows systems to improve their performance by learning from data without being explicitly programmed.

4. **Interpretation and Decision Making**
   Ultimately, the goal is to translate analytical results into actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions. This could mean optimizing a marketing campaign, improving customer experience, detecting fraud, or even advancing scientific research.

#### hiring order/value order

Hire people that are good at the things you're not, especially if you want that first hire to be your right hand man/deputy

First build your foundation: Hire at least one data engineer and/or analytics engineer. Data engineer should be focused on building a data platform (including ingestion/storing and mlops/devops) rather than just pipelines to create something scalable for the overall team. You want someone with the mindset of "how can i build something that outlasts me"? while an analytics engineer is closer to the business and focused on business transformations and making sense of raw data. At this stag, they should also be platform-focused and work closely with data eng

Then focus on adding value to the business: hire analysts with a strategy/BI background focused on what the company needs to scale - e.g. sales operations vs marketing (different backgrounds). Don't hire analysts if your data engineering or analytics engineers don't have a solid foundation set up for the analysts to succeed

Add more engineers and analysts

Then maybe a data scientist - or upskill your existing analytics engineers/analysts if they're interested. Only hire a data scientist that is strong on the programming. You don't need a statistician at this size.

data is open ended

 Some roles will be mainly implementing existing machine learning models for a new business problem, this would be commonly called a machine learning engineer. Or you can 


In some companies you will need to understand the algorithm because that is how the business will live or die, because it is the main product of the business

Productionisiation.

Also more or less domain knowledege heavy. ( Foundatin models can apply to many areas) 



Do you really need to understand the algorthims? (Improving data is better)
Skill sets - e.g. data scientists mainly use python but don't put code into production






Data Scientists help create and deliver actionable insights necessary to drive innovation and growth - They lead business success via strategic, data-driven decision-making.



A data scientist must be able to solve any problem related to data (big or small) and must have a solid background in things such as sampling and probability/stats. He/she must be able to derive interpretable causal relationships from data and not just make blind predictions. This is a role which focuses on prototyping and business insights for advanced reporting. It usually requires a specialised modeling-focused academic background.

A ML engineer on the other hands focuses strictly on training and productionizing models for prediction. This role doesn't care about sampling and probability because models are usually trained on very large datasets. The problems ML engineers are trying to solve focus on black box but highly accurate pattern matching and rarely on interpretation. They must be excellent users of ML tools and very tech-savvy in order to deploy and maintain models in production (and no, this is not something that can be done by any DevOps engineer with no explicit training). This ML/MLOps engineering role can filled by a software engineer who has undergone specialised professional training, and does not require a DS or modelling-based academic background. The ML engineer's understanding of data science is more superficial, but their tech skills are on par with any software or DevOps engineer in the company.



My hot take is that the most valuable data scientists are good analysts first and foremost. You can't "build AI products" or even do machine learning without knowing how to deeply understand your data, and that's what an analyst does. It doesn't mean you should stay in a job that doesn't appeal to you, but don't get sucked into the hype and think that other data scientists are sitting there saving the world with algorithms while you miss out.

## A brief history of data science and why it's useful

Data analysts existed before 2012.

Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, is known to have said, “The sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. People think I’m joking, but who would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy job of the 1990s?”

data science is not a mature field?

people aren't good at listing what they need, and sometimes even knowing what hey need

really good thread on machine learning engineering resources


There are 3 courses that I usually recommend to folks looking to get into MLE/MLOps that already have a technical background. The first is a higher-level look at the MLOps processes, common challenges and solutions, and other important project considerations. It's one of Andrew Ng's courses from Deep Learning AI but you can audit it for free if you don't need the certificate:

- Machine Learning in Production

For a more hands-on, in-depth tutorial, I'd recommend this course from NYU (free on GitHub), including slides, scripts, full-code homework:

- Machine Learning Systems

And the title basically says it all, but this is also a really good one:

- Hands-on Train and Deploy ML

Pau Labarta, who made that last course, actually has a series of good (free) hands-on courses on GitHub. If you're interested in getting started with LLMs (since every company in the world seems to be clamoring for them right now), this course just came out from Pau and Paul Iusztin:

- Hands-on LLMs

For LLMs I also like this DLAI course (that includes Prompt Engineering too):

- Generative AI with LLMs

It can also be helpful to start learning how to use MLOps tools and platforms. I'll suggest Comet because I work there and am most familiar with it (and also because it's a great tool). Cloud and DevOps skills are also helpful. Make sure you're comfortable with git. Make sure you're learning how to actually deploy your projects.

Good luck! :)
