basically most people are mostly occupied with their own interests

they don't see how EA would tie into theeir personal wellbeing. They're focused on themselves and their families.

Lack of clear impact on the community. No university endorsement. Noclear success story. No clear person whos's made a a massive impact on the world through EA. E.g. bill and melinda gates eradicating polio, or givewell saving lives. EA doesn't have as clear a metric.

most of the problems focus on really big problems/claims that are usually hard to understand/take a lot of prior knowledge to understand. people feel they can't even get started working on it. existential threaths. hard to scope. problem of humanity distribution. low likelihood high severity. Frame likelihood as a matter of time. Be more clear about uncertainty.

No strong figureheads. Most figureheads are in a very particular niche, and EA targets highly effective individuals first.

Rationalists are mostly nerdy/curse of knowledge. Don't know how to communicate their ideas as well.s

what should the average person do based on EA advice?
-have the right priorities, in work and personal life and implement them.
- donate  abit of money where you can


hard to chose an impactful career becuase of economics of labor market.
