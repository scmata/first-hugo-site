#### solving hard problems

If you are a typical STEM graduate or student, you will felt the urge to solve "interesting hard technical problems". However, this thinking often limits you to a certain scope of problems. You will want to apply the new techniques you learnt in class and improve on the state of the art. The thing is, in the real world this often isn't a good solution. The added effort of new technology can distract you from other business problems like finding product market fit for example. This is something that has become more and more apparent to me as I've [read and reread Ben Kuhn's article on this issue](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/).

#### The issue with solving problems after school

The issue is that for most of your education, most of the hard problems you've solved before have a solution. That's becuase it needed to be tested and marked against other people. In high school, doing problem solving competitions like the UKMT Maths Challenge or science olympiads still lead to this conclusion.

The issue is that most problems do not have a clear solution. In fact, defining what success means so that you know when you have finished a task is a key skill. Generally, the more interesting the problem the harder it is to measure. For example, in my thesis I wanted to measure the similarity of an LLM's generation to a reference sentence. I spent two weeks just figuring out the best way to do this.

##### The issue with solving technical problems

The other issue with solving IHTPs is that most of the most interesting problems involve non-technical components. First of all, generally anything you develop will be used by a human at some point (unless you work in pure math). Solving human problems are definitely not technical in nature. Learning how to trnstion them is

you want to be different, however the best way is to solve the problems everyone has thought about before. ( i used to chase new problems)

The other issue is that 





You can spend your life on some of these problem


how to be a good parent





most of the hard problems you've solved before have a solution. or at least a rubric that people mark it against.

even maths challenge or olympiad, some of the hardest high school problems, have soluitons.

in the real world, we struggle to even define 



my experience of solving hard problems. football field analogy

space of possibilities is enormous

most rewarding problems are those that can't be easily solved, so we have best approximations instead

how do we teach people?

how do we hire the best person?

quite often the most novel technology isn't the best. use boring etchnology

it would be nice to approach the biggest problems in life from a rationalist perspective. but usually they're far too big for us to solve.
have a plan, top down vs bottom up
