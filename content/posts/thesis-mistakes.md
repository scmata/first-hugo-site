# Thesis stuff

The biggest mistakes I made when doing my thesis and my biggest advice.


The thesis was one of my proudest pieces of work from my time in Princeton. It took a lot of time and effort and I learnt a lot. I also made a lot of mistakes. So lets go through stuff here.

If you want to read it, it is here.



- Find something you are interested in
You will be making it your own. You want to be invested.

- Find a good supervisor
- Learn how to communicate with supervisors

To show that your work is cool/relevant.

Talk about it! You probably won't know much about the topic at the start, and by the end you will be on the forefront of knowledge in that specific thing.

Start writing early. Bullet points are good. Don't write from top to bottom. 

Explaining things takes time. And results.

When writing you always want to think about your audience. You don't need an introduction that is too detailed.

Most important section at beginning is research idea and method and literature review. Next is results and discussion. People read that first to see the relevance of your work and what you think you would build on. Abstract is very important. Get some style guides too/sources from other people.

- Have a plan/cut off date

Project management in general. If you take it seriously it should be top of your mind-but still this isn't a bulletproof strategy. Just working on it in all your spare time isn't either. Need to be aware of your direction, and to not be worried if something doesn't work out.

The research is more fun

- Writing takes way more time than you think. Especially if you have decent results
