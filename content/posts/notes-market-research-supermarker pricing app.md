thinking about price comparison website


what do you need

-people to usually spend time comparing/researching the price or specs
-need to have a regular amount of people shopping for it
- ideally high value goods, with limited catalog so you can compare more easily


consumer benefit - can tell teh supermarket to price match so they get cashback, or always get the lowest prices


there are some things that are hard to compare e.g. kettles, because tesco will stock a diverse range of kettles from different manufacturers and john lewis will stock a different and slightly, but not completely overlapping range. it's difficult to algorithmically compare with the things people decide over, e.g. colour, size, price, appearance, vibe,
