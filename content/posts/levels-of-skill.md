Something I've been thinking about recently is the levels of skill needed for different activities.


10,000 hours for mastery.

The first 2 hours you can do hello world, or mary had a little lamb.

The first 40 hours you can do something and show it off yourself. Maybe rip tide or something. Or introduce yourself in a language and know a couple sentences.


Then there's a point.




Skils are not categorically separate. Lots of them have common foundations. e.g. muscality for dancing and playing an instrument.

Balance for basketball and taekwondo.
