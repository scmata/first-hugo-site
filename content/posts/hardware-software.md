# Entering the Information Age
#### How innovation is shifting from the physical to the virtual — and why that might not actually make life better


The UK and US economies are increasingly dominated by services and the virtual world (bits) which manipulate information rather than physical goods (atoms) which manipulate energy. This shift has major implications which may not be all positive. In manufacturing economies, productivity gains came from improving physical processes — improving engines, machines, and materials. In the digital economy, however, improvements are harder to achieve and often come from optimising algorithms that recommend products, predict behaviour, or execute trades. These advances can make systems more efficient, but they don’t always translate into tangible improvements in people’s lives like the invention of vaccines and planes did before. Still, the information economy is only growing, and understanding how this virtual world shapes the physical one is becoming more important than ever.


#### Some context: The energy age: 1 million BC to 1960

To understand how technology helps peoples lives, a brief review of history is useful. Humans have been developing and creating new technology since we existed, from language and fire to AI and jet engines. Tracking how developed a society is is a difficult task, and is one which we often use GDP for right now, which is a measure of how much trade is going on in a society. Another measure which Ian Morris suggest is the ability for a society to extract and use energy is a measure of its success or power (or at least sets up the selective pressures under which society evolves).

If we look at many of the inventions throughout history, many of the ones that directly improve human lives are related to our ability to harness energy. This includes fire, the steam engine, electricity and guns. And mining for stuff like steel and farming.

Since the 1600s we had a big increase in productivity since advances in physics and science helped us manipulate these energy flows with a lot more understanding, creating effieinct engines and electricity. Making things like planes and flight possible. Even advances in biology like vaccines extending human lifespans could be thought of as increasing energy flows since humans who live longer are able to do more work (e.g. farm or build more, or literally move  more objects).

Nevertheless, advances in the way we share information also existed. For example, the developments of first spoken language, then written language and the printing press were very important for people to share ideas between communities and countries and across generations. However, books were not useful in and of themselves, they were useful because they could teach you how to do something. To invent new things, like telescopes and watermills and trains and sewage systems.

#### Now the information age

However, leading up to the 1960s and beyond the rate of innovation in the spread of information began to increase. First we had telephones and fax, then computers, then the internet and mobile devices. 

However, with this ability to share information much more easily I think a new kind of innovation emerged. While information inventions before were useful because they could share ideas more quickly, the new types of information inventions such as the computer could process information for us by performing calculaions e.g. nasa space missions. Then came a point where information processing became profitable by itself, creating algorithms to invest in stock markets or to target specific customers to increase profit. Often making systems more efficient by performing better than humans.

Now whole companies are made on just selling data. Note that inventions like credit and insurance were necessary to be able to be optimised. And also quite often scale is necessary to optimse. E.g. saving 5% of costs with a call center with 10 employees and 10,000 can have an ROI of £200 or £200,000 if each employee costs £1000 to employ.

And now it seems that information processing has taken over the world. In the S&P 500 tech companies make up over 40%. Creations like social networks, digital market places and even email have made life much easier in some ways. This trend is visible everywhere, my favourite example being sports. Humans are generally starting to reach a limit of physical ability in sports like basketball, football and athletics, and instead their skills are improving and they generally have to get a lot smarter. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure every professional sports league employs data scientists to break down things like shooting percentages across different areas of teh court to inform tactics.

However, in the same way that a book doesn't dramtatically change your ability to live your life, in terms of where you can go or what you can do. These improvements in effieincy also may have limited impact on people's wellbeing. We are making many improvements in the virtual world, but (at least for now) people live in the physical world. 

#### Why this might not actually make the world a better place

I think the potentially dangerous thing is is creating virtual (or software or bits) innovations without a reflection on how they actually improve people's lives. Taking social media as an example, we have algorithms extensively trained on maximising watch time and understanding their perferences to recommend them products they would buy. This can be very useful technology, but I think taken too far it can be detrimental - and it can manipulate people without them even realising. For example, the people addicted to social media. It may be one reason the young generation right now are vastly more lonely than any other generation.

Hence, focusing on imrpovements on information processing without actually thinking about how they affect human lives in the end could be detrimental. And it is pretty easy to create a company that optimises on data without needing to interact with real people.

Furthermore, in the UK and USA we are taking big bets on AI improving our lives. For example, with massive investment into building up data centers which is important to note that they will use up a lot of physical energy that could be used for manufacturing and will potentially contribute to glboal warming, and which will increase the cost of electricity. So we had better make sure that the investments in AI lead to innovations that actually improve people's lives.

##### Areas of information for the future

In the near future at least, I think our development around the information will only increase and become more sophisticated. It seems to me that as data gets more available more and more traditioally non-computational disciplines can be optimised by data science methods. Computatinal social science is an emerging subject

Predicting crime etc

Some examples

- We can predict cardiovascular mortality at the community level from twitter language better than common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors such as smoking and diabetes
- Understanding the reading habits of charles darwin from an information perspective
- Robots are becoming increasingly more autonomous, capable of basic decision making
- Self driving cars
- A potential addition of social engineers who apply social science principles
- Brain Computer interfaces

#### Some mathematical context

Use bayes law to explain why everything might be a foundation model in the future.

Also mention information and energy are the same thing.

Rent seeking behaviour from large multinational corporations e.g. google already has android which is 70% of the world's mobile devices.

Even worse because of ability of data to manipulate people's emotions and viewpoints without them realising, as social media is able to do. Such as sense when you are more susceptible to buying stuff.

investment in virtual world will lead to improvement in the physical

is an interesting trend,

In a recent article, I expresed the sentiment that as an engineer sometimes it felt innovation was slowing down in terms of how much my life has been changed in the last 20 years. This might be tied to the fact that innovation has become increasingly virtual, and I want to explore that concept more.

bias because economic productivity has been pretty much stagnant for my whole life.


To give a quick history lesson, a lot of past innovations were shaped by humanity's ability to produce and shape energy into different forms on macro scales. If a society could control energy better, it could grow faster than other societies and eventually dominate. Think about inventions like fire and farming. Later this became stuff like the steam engine. Furthermore, advances in science like physics and chemistry allowed us to use energy in different ways to create planes, guns, more efficient engines and new materials like steel.


#inventions like credit and insurance

The inventions of language, then writing then the printing press.

Before AI, the main change seemed like phones and computers got a bit better. This is reflected in the biggest companies in the S & P being things like apple, google, microsoft and amazon. However, to me this is a signal of a wider trend of innovation increasingly including software (information) as well as hardware (energy).

Genetic engineering

However, alongside this trend in our ability to shape energy is an ability to shape information. The computers and internet have been huge innovations. For example, social networks which social networks, can connect people of similar interests much quicker, digitla market places where you can view all products more easily and easier to fill out forms and stuff. 

This trend is everywhere even in sports.

This age of information is different because instead of increasing our knowledge to make better tools that shape physical innovation, a lot of innovation is happening in the virtual world. However, this also means how it improves peoples lives is more abstract.
