**Scholarships can be the catalyst** that propel you toward a thriving career and a prosperous future.

They come in **all sorts of flavours** (including academic, music, financial need, sporting achievement, industry). Besides the money, they are one of the **highest returns on investment** on yourself you can make. **You owe it to yourself** to find and apply for them (and grants and bursaries).

**If you aren't convinced yet**, here are some reasons you should be applying for them **now**.

##  1. Free money
If you are already eligible for a scholarship, filling out the 1-3 pages of questions for Â£5000 or more can be **some of the quickest money you'll ever make.**
## 2. It builds your personal brand
Receiving scholarships helps you stand out from the crowd and gives you a **badge of credibility** to introduce yourself. **The more competitive the scholarship**, the more prestigious it will be.

## 3. It offers you a community
Scholarships can give you an opportunity to meet people like you, or even better - **people you want to be like.** Remember who said **you are the sum of your 5 closest people**? This can work particularly well for schemes targeted at **underrepresented backgrounds** e.g. women in STEM, ethnic minorities.

## 4. It gives you professional connections

Being associated with the scholarship body can make it easier to apply for certain **internships or jobs** they  have connections to.

Furthermore, **you can find mentors.** Either the scheme will place you with them or you can source them from past scholars. These people can give you some of the best advice because **they were in your shoes not long ago.**

## 5.You can practise selling yourself
The application process will help you practise presenting yourself in best **writing and interviews.** This is a skill you will **need your whole life** for job applications.

## 6. It gives you perspective
In the process of applying you often have to discuss your current strengths and **goals for the future.** This is something you should be doing anyway, but is another great **opportunity to reflect.**

## 7. It's an investment into your future
Why not apply? **These schemes will open doors to unseen opportunities.**
