# Conditions necessary and obstacles that get in the way of mastery and grwoth

- so basically three main ingredients, you need goals, you need internal desire and good environments to support you

^this is basically the why, the how as a bit different and involves how you structure your practice and training (your speciifc environment will help a lot with that) and also comprehsnible input and flow, not be afraid to be rejected

Some people want to achieve great things. However, many things can get in the way. In this article I discuss a lot of the obstacles that can get in the way of your "why". Sometimes I've noticed people get bored or plateu. Other people might be talented but they struggle with the hard work to get through to the next level. Others might struggle with motivation. These are some of the things I disucss.

# Having big goals is important

Most ambitious people have goals and dreams and I think this is very important. Having goals can give you motivation, both when you are just starting out and much worse than most people, and when you get better and are finding fewer peers and less competition. By setting the goal as well, you have to acknowledge your current abilities and limiations, and have to work out how to improve them to reach your goal.

One of the most valuable things a goal can give you is discipline, although it is not required it can greatly help. If you really dedicate yourself to a goal you will find any means to reach your end. You can be disciplined, cut out toxic people and aren't afraid of rejection. This type of motivation is important because it makes you dedicated. It is necesssary for any type of success, becuase maybe some people will be have more talent, or come from a more wealthy area or have better parents. But even talent without discipline results in working minimum wage reminiscing about how you peaked in high school. (My theory is that greatness is talent times hard work).

So in fact, in order to achieve anything it seems vital to dream and have goals - otherwise why would you try anything in the first place. However, for a dream to really be a dream you can't really appreciate all the challenges or the details of the goal you have, hence believing in it requires some faith or delusion. This also means that a dream has to be outside of your current abilities, otherwise it would stop being a dream once you achieve it easily. In fact, there is a common saying that many great leaders and businessmen would not have gone through everything they did to achive their dream, if they knew the sacrifices it would take - to their mental health, family relationships and stress.

# The issue with achieving your goals

> David Foster Wallace - "The ultimate way you and I get lucky is if we have some success early on, and find out that it doesn’t mean anything."

Problems occur when you achieve your dream. This dream could be anything - to be number 1 in your sport, to buy a house, to get a great body. However, when many people achieve their dream they feel momentary happiness, and then they still feel they're not living their dream life. So they choose another dream to chase, which makes them have purpose again. 

One difference is that many people set goals which are related to social outcomes and material goods, but they're not tied to our health, lifestyle and happiness. Without that as a baseline, you will be unhappy chasing any goal you set. However, even with health as a foundation, it doesn't mean chasing our goals will make us content. 

The other focus to be aware of, is the focus on the process not only the goal. One quote I have heard is "The reward for great work is more great work". Find the great work that you want to do, and keep doing it. Because once you find it, you also won't want to stop.

# The importance of sticking to your own desires and goals

> Joseph Agassi - "My advice to you: try hard not to work. You’ll find out, and people will find that parasitic, but if you look around you will find that only the people who did what they wanted to do contributed to society significantly."

In order to fall in love with the process and to be able to set good goals, you need understand internally what you enjoy doing and what you care about. And nurture and develop that, because it is unique to you.

However, focusing just on your internal desires probably won't give you satisfcation - unless you don't mind being a starving artist. You also need to understand the shape of the work you contribute to society. Satisfying work will come from the intersection of what society finds useful and what you truly enjoy doing. If you can find that, you are a very lucky person. 

If you are a disciplined person who can chase goals, you can probably get better at a lot of things. But being able to stick to what makes you tick can be difficult, because it may make you feel lonely. You may be the only person in your school or neighborhood who likes drawing manga, or the intersection between culture an AI, or the 200m hurdles. This can create other obstacles:

#### The false illusions of admiration

Once you've devoted some time to a skill, you will probably often hear the phrase "you're so talented" from general audiences. This can be harmful to developing your skills, because you may already think you've made it but in fact you're only beginning. My best example is a black belt in most martial arts - most people will be very impressed becuase you clearly have skill and outshine much of the general public but actually practioners will understand it is only the beginning and there is always something else to learn, with many people better than you.

In fact, getting to the point where people say "you're so talented" does not take that much work in general in the grand scheme of things. It is an achievement, but feeling like it's towards the end of your growth is giving yourself a glass ceiling. What you really want is to be understood by other practioners. Instead of commenting on talent they can say "I can understand the hard work and practice it took to get to this point", they can relate and connect to your struggle.

This applies to any field. People want to relate to struggle. Imagine a music artist performing for a crowd, and the after the show and an audience member says the show was great and their talent was unbeleivable. Compare that to a fellow musician who comes, who understands the difficulty of learning choreography, the hours spent practising scales, the tears spilt getting over injuries. If they compliment your performance, they will be able to give much more detailed commentary and you will feel much mroe connected to them.

# This idea of connecting over struggle

In the end to not get bored by something, you need continuous growth and challenge. Otherwise you will stagnate. And this has to come from other people, from community.

Usian bolt couldnt run by himself and he needed others, in fact he got bored.

#### The incompleteness of being by yourself (this also applies to being in a league of your own)

"Hell is other people"


####  Why people quit: lack of community and comprehensible input/challenge

It's lack of growth but the underlying cause is lack of community/environment that allows you to grow. The thing that can hide this from people is that 


#### The solution: You need to find your participants community

The community might have to change, as you out grow old ones. But 


The love of the game, finding community

the starving artist would feel no pleasure if nobody at all enjoyed his art. although he might feel driven to express himself into the world.

hell is other people, but sometimes it can be our heaven

Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan, couldn't be considered the greats they are if nobody had played against them. Usain bolt would not be driven to be the world's fastest man if he didn't have other people to race. 

# Discipline
You can't change the environment you're born into, your genes or how you were brought up, but you can control your mindset.

#### How this manifests

- The flow state and comprehinsible input
you also need to train and stuff





Life is not a competition

david foster wallace quote, the quote about stick to your own passions and maybe make up a quote about finding environments which help you grow
- so basically three main ingredients, you need goals, you need internal desire and good environments to support you


having goals can give you motivation, both when you are just starting out and much worse than most people, and when you get better and are finding fewer peers and less competition.
