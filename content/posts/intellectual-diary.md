# Stuff I've seen



20/6/2025 - A bunch of stuff by Ben Francis. Seems like a great guy. (Met him on the train on Wednesday)

24/6/2025 - [A poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/t37ocb/letting_the_cat_out_of_the_bag_from_united_auto/)

[A cool visualisation](https://engaging-data.com/how-rich-is-elon-musk/)

[Black researchers in the UK](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04386-w/index.html#:~:text=Starting%20out,more%20diverse%20range%20of%20students.)

(Winter 2024 books I read)
Sticky book...

#### 28/6/25

- Read a lot of essays from tech people on career advice. It's satisfying to read something and not understand completely in the moment for it to make sense later (also probably cause im more aligned to tech now)
- For some reason I always come back to young money every year or so

- [How to work hard](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)
- [Altman. How to be successful ](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

Meeting Ben Francis really shone a light on how he understands high performers like CEOs work, himself included. Just on a different level to most people.




- Watched some Ali Abdaal. Seeing his general productivity content is sometimes too broad reminds me of the power of niche,

How AI will change the world for high achievers
basically a limited amount was on the internet before (up to approx. an undergraduate education)
- makes accessing that way faster 
- also successful people used to blog, now more of them will be on social media -> we get a better understanding of them.
- before people had to write books abount them -> filtered opinion
[an article on this](https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/tech-entrepreneurship-and-the-disruption-of-ambition-4e6854121992)

Finding out what successful people are like
can ask POVs of successful people
NB what successful people appear like is not what they are necessariy. look at opinions from other high achieving people, survey works or ask them yourself
being around them will also make other things salient that you don't realise e.g. me being around olympians and hard work being more salient

why do I drink? maybe I should quit

[text](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/teaching-problem-solving-undergraduate-mathematics.pdf)

[Terrance Tao on maths](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)
- the three stages are similar for most technical subjects

David Dobbs
[How to be genius](https://talentdevelop.com/articles/HTBAG.html)
Decade of dedication

"This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach."
In my experience of sports, most technical ones require at least around 4-7 years to be pretty good at a university level

Could talk about my experience of talent

[TT on parenting for gifted children](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/advice-on-gifted-education/)
- Dublin Centre for Talented Youth

I suspect most Oxford students must probably all be slightly neurodierse in some way

[Lemonade stand dragons den simulation for complex decision making](https://youtu.be/yGvXwTu3n4U?si=k5eL7Bwxk6RlITfn&t=1748)

Seems like an effective exercise to generate utility similar to this Ben Kuhn article about staring into the [abyss](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)

[Another article by BK on complex decision making](https://www.benkuhn.net/conviction/#:~:text=Since%20I%20had%20plenty%20of%20free%20time%2C%20I%20spent%20it%20thinking%20through%20my%20plans%20from%20first%20principles.)



- we have rigorous athlete training programs, what are our intellectual ones? Harder becuase less of a reward function like 100 metre times

- All Debates Are Bravery Debates -> advice depends on not just the individual, but the group

- How I want to reverse the stereotype fo Oxford
 "The stereotype of, e.g., MIT alums that end up spending the rest of their life only hanging out with other MIT students, does happen to some people. It’s a reasonable personal choice (normal people can be annoying!), but if you’re optimizing for impact on the rest of the world, it will be a handicap."

- what does college actually represent (to employers)? reverse engineering job applications
Basically that you worked hard at something, and the you do an additional skills based assessment on top of that


- Anthpo was kids with crocs and he was really happy he got 10k followers (you don't need to have the biggest goal to start off with)

- "I actually think college is a pretty garbage place to explore your interests because you find out what it’s like to take classes about your interests, but that’s not actually what your interests are going to look like for the rest of your life. " BK

I think the scott galloway thing said happiness is 20% genetic

There must be a list of biases from popular media
- 
Biases from popular media

- that you have a calling
- that you [either have talent or hard work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n)
-that geniuses exist

"The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard."


Before I used to chase places I wouldn't be bored/would challenge me, to be surrounded by the smartest people
now that metric doesnt exist as easily anymore
maybe YC for example could be a place
Now I think I have a slightly more complex metric. e.g. 


Be aware of our assumptions and what media sells you e.g. [Steve Jobs didn't do it all himself](https://guzey.com/autistic-leaders/)
(Business skills are hard to gain)

[financial distance and tax evasion](https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/01/power-buys-you-distance-from-the-crime/)

I should improve my PM skills e.g. make success inevitable https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/#make-success-inevitable


[i could move to Africa...emerging markets...](https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/)


Why is there no canon for life's most important questions?

If we go to study economics, we quickly become familiar with The Wealth of Nations and Keyne's General Theory. If we become interested in moral philosophy, we swiftly encounter Reasons and Persons and A Theory of Justice. But for many of life's most important questions, we won't find any similar canon. That is, there are no similarly definitive books about how to navigate your education, how to select a career, how to choose a partner, how to be a good friend, or how to raise your children well. That's not to say that there aren't lots of books on these questions. There are, of course. But there are none that are so good, or important, that you might assume that others interested in the questions will be familiar with their ideas. Is it not possible for there to be "great" books about these questions? Or have they just not been written yet?


Everybody writes for at least version of themselves. You can't write to an audience you don't relate with at all (as far as I know).

Read the best book first

hackathons must be going crazy rn with AI??

i realised this a bit ago) not every business needs to be a vc business

28/6/2025

You get paid for top down/open ended skills. E.g. strategy consulting, management

complex problem solving

or bottom up skill, usually hard skills more or less with training e.g. engineering, coding


the real opportunity is when you can combine the two. That's basically an entrepreneur

i thought i need to make the perfect idea, spend a lot of time making it good. launch it and people would love it and then live happy ever after. It doesn't work like that!
and it takes time to break our misconceptions

Most metrics of things that actually matter suck

a degree in product management would be so versatile in today's society

companies could iterally post curriculums they want you to learn

it's easiest to sell the product when you truly believe in it (including yourself)


"We live in a time where it's easier to reach the entire world than it is to reach your neighborhood." this hit hard...

[interesting channel-real people](https://www.youtube.com/@RealPeopleTV/videos)
On April 18, 1979 at 8pm a new kind of television series was born. The format was so different no one had a way to describe it yet. The New York Times said it blurred the lines between news and entertainment. Producer George Schlatter agreed and called it “theater of reality.” In the days before the internet and YouTube, everyday people were given a spotlight for the first time. The show brought people around the country closer as it celebrated accomplishments big and small, the quirky, the challenged, and in some of its best moments, paid tribute to real life heroes in the military. Defying description, Real People went on to become a huge hit for NBC during its five years, giving rise to many imitators and eventually creating the genre, reality television.

"Advice number 2 reminds me of this silly tiny change that made my life so much better! All I did was spend about $3 on a charger cable that's way too short to reach my bed from the outlet and I gave my long cable away. At nights, I had no choice but to leave my phone away from me when the battery died and I could no longer watch tiktok for hours.

Been very interested in economics recently too. It's interesting because for example what people pay for stuff isn't necessarily its true value, so what affects this?

It's interesting because economics is about a lot more than just money, and some metrics like PPP try and represent this.

While we do focus on the increase in wealth in terms of money since that's the main thing we mweasure. Increases in stuff like livelihood and happiness can lead to longterm incresaes in wealth anyway, so for those money obsessed it still comes down to the same thing e.g. trying to increase productivity in the long run.

The “bitter lesson” in AI is that general methods that leverage increases in computational power eventually surpass methods that utilize human domain knowledge by a large margin. This is a valuable observation about methods, but it is often misinterpreted to encompass application development. In the context of AI-based product development, the bitter lesson has never been even close to true. Consider recommender systems on social media: They are powered by (increasingly general) machine learning models, but this has not obviated the need for manual coding of the business logic, the frontend, and other components which, together, can comprise on the order of a million lines of code.

need to include my chat with AI about implementing FPTP in normal elections (chatGPT or gemini probably)

selection pressure of an idea
- how impactful/entertaining it is (Psychological Attractiveness, Social Utility or Identity Signaling)
- how easy it is to replicate (how easy it it to understand and then communicate)
- Compatibility with Existing Beliefs/ how believeable it is

Anthpo's structure of ideas

6 principles of influence/pyschology of consumption


social liking

how we consume things/are influenced. all of our feelings and emotion can be categorised into one of these six things
-scarcity (Michael reeves, aura)
-consistency (can still upload every year but be scarce)
-reciprocity
-consensus (if it has a million likes it's easier to watch)
-similarity (can't repeat the formula, have to innovate on it with context). have text on screen have your face in first frame. if you follow every thing in rulebook people won't care because it's already been done
-authority (effort can also help with this -because it shows it's worth listening to)

how e.g. career ideas spread? in america it's easier than in the UK
another example. fitness influencers. they typically have autheority and consistency. potentialy similarity and consensus too. the biggest ones do most of these

i wonder how this applies to those memories that you have of 10+ years ago which really impacted how you saw the world e.g. when talking with your parents
or your parents' memories of you when you were young and which memories/stories they choose to tell ig. what they think most describes/is relevant to you ig and how entertianing/fun the story is to tell

why flexing yourself improves your standing and also social inequality because you share your knowledge to increase the spread of information from elite sources and increase the culture of sharing your knowledge to level the playing field once everyone knows how to

or even like fitness influencers. need to give thiese marketing tools the most to people who are actually impactful. to help balance the inflationary view of marketing.

idea: marketing makes long term economics less efficient because a company can have more perceived value (especially to consumers, but also partially to businesses) because of marketing. 

imagine food was just sold in paper bags with standard names in the supermarket. you would just buy food based on its quality. 

Removing marketing from the equation isn't really feasible though, so we should try and do our best to democratise education around all companies/businesses/people.

another idea: do a study on how following instagram fitness influencers affects workout performance. maybe for two groups that have planned workouts, one with social media and one without 

north star effect tho

the idea is to understand how social media following affects motivation/knowledge with something measurable e.g. fitness gains

some hypotheses: doom scrolling fitness but not acc doing it doesn't help you. correlation bewteen watching fitness and doing it means people who watch the content are fitter. 

it's like the starved for information thing. like are you actually learning.

maybe do it with learning -> following a bunch of physics accounts (or could do another field), then somebody who watches a bunch of YT videos (e.g. 3blue1brown ) while both are doing a physics course or something.

trying to capture the videos that give you the sense that you feel like you're learning but you're actually not e.g. video essays. quite often it's a balance tho bewteen information and entertainment

a lot of these apply to EA like similarity/curse of knowledge. if you just go on the website it doesn't tell you in a simple concrete way relative to what you already do, what you should do to improve the world

e.g. they tell you what you should work on but that relies on having a specific mental model already (that most people don't have) to reach that conclusion. instead should market towards a different mental model.



the way you're able to synthesise this is repeated experiemtns through a lot of different enviornments (naturalistic) as well as specific testing methodoolgy.

also all likes and views are not the same. e.g. x likes on a personal vlog is very differnt to a random guy on tiktok flexing his jawline

creators in politics
that one cyprus guy
podcasts in the US 2024 election
trump is very good at going viral and stuff

social media and the spreading of ideas is becoming way more importnat
also companies are slowly figuing this out. e,g, crocs hiring anthpo, but not knowing if it's successful till the washington post writes about it

also one person/small group of people probably had a bigger influence than a lot of money paying one celebrity to wear it potentially

how does a brand show up to a party and not be a stranger. how does it show up and be cool with the group of friends, have good aura kind of

anthpo has a plan for failure too
following a trend not making one. idea in marketing

the framework for art and comedy. simalarity/commentary but slightly different
making people feel something with art.


viewing from a third party POV. leave it for two days and give it the fresh eye watch.

unit of conversation vs unit of entertainment

maybe make a cool carousel post too

anthpo doesn't really feel like he's speaking corporate speak on the podcast, feels authentic joking around and stuff
"love of the game" -> building on the current culture. an artist of social media combined with some pyschological principles

good conversationalist, passionate about people

it also shows that most cool things take time, with the amount of time he spends on editing

a thing reaches saturation when a company can train people to do it easily. the world is definitely not near that level with social media yet -> there's a lot fo opportunity, first to get good at experimenting and second at codifying knowledge

that's why staying on top of innovation is important. most people are not early adopters lol, they adopt it when it gets easy to use and is mainstream

that thing of breaking past yoru limits, japanese thing or something

how to measure your life
children learn when they're ready to learn. and they use their own generative models to figure out how their parents got to where they are. they instincetively probably want to emulate them in some way or use their expertise.

e.g. education is important can only be seen if parents got to their current point through education or are still studying
r.g. my dad trying to learn business(to an extent)
(altho being entrepreneurial and taking risks maybe doesn't work that well if the risks don't pay off-need to take measured risks)

or using phones etc.

kids essentially look at the actions of their parents and see what results it produces and backtrack to see how it should affect their policy/view on life

used to enjoy frameworks e.g. types of learners in school, work hard or they're smart or (in the middle). or they don't care/are not smart/are stupid. (or both smart and work hard?? tho i dont think this level of granularity matters)

i remember 3 types

something like tat

i used to be disappointed in the worl daround 14 when i saw so much of it can be described by simple patterns and frameworks. people make the same mistakes.but you can help improve those mistakes!! through education/information e.g. about frameworks of wisdom

so they can learn through experience more quickly and not make the same ones. and to avoid making the biggest mistakes maybe e.g. like smoking or addiction.

or even in relationshops. by helping people learn about themselves and to get rid of trauma or bad intuitions learnt in childhood (e.g. like anxious/avoidant vocab helps you learn about yourself)

esp when I was younger, tried to steer away from stuff that had too many details/where frameworks didn't work as well and tacit knowledge become moore important. e.g. game development in unity.
tried to maximise my framework learning i guess

He introduces what he calls “Truman’s Law” to explain this. According to a story, U.S. President Harry Truman once said that a “truly great president is right 51% of the time.” This might sound like a low bar, but it reveals a deeper truth: in complex, unpredictable systems—like war, leadership, or history—even a slight edge in good decisions over bad ones can make a leader (or a process) successful in the long run.

in Britain, in World War II, obviously there was serious food rationing of course. People’s health got better because of the massively improved equality of access to nutrition. These are just extraordinary facts to me, but I’m not sure what the conclusion is.

Need to have STAR in companies

As a mathematician working in decision making, I am happy that you make a video on such topics. 
I also appreciate that you mention some of these better alternative systems (see also "Majority jugement" from Balinski & Laraki).
I believe it would be great that you spend some time to explain one of these alternative system in detail, and show their strength.

Now, there is on crucial thing you did not adress in your video: ensuring people actually deviate from  the highly risky "first past the post"  system.
 If we keep presenting these only with example of presidential elections, it is likely that nobody will change our voting systems for a few more centuries. 
 But when you realize that the "first past the post" system is actually used everywhere, from family circle, friends,  associations, companies, etc, you can understant the massive risk it creates on a societal scale. The moment a CEO understands the risks it takes by using the "simplest" system in a company, he/she will try something else: and at this point almost ever other system is better. 
 Indeed, since "first past the post" does worse than just possibly electing bad propositoin: it actively favors the most cleaving proposition. Hence imagine the massive risk this creates when applying this in a governing board ! (and most companies use it without even being aware of the risk)
 
 Hence I  humbly suggest you make another video, with other examples of decision, focusing on the risk of "first past the post" system, and discussing one concrete alternative in detail.
The idea, I believe is to first convince companies, associations, and people to stop using this crazy system in their collective decisions and use an alternative one. The moment they try an alternative, they win.
I'll be happy to further dicuss such points.

bad ideas seem like good ideas
History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect it seems obvious they were going to make it big. For that reason one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to me when I first heard about it. A site for college students to waste time? It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.


to get into oxford it helps a lot to know someone who's been there as a mentor e.g. school coordinator for oxbridge in KES, tells you mentality, what you should be doing for PS, goals and baseline for grades, personal statement etc

that's probably a very important thing

According to our special report on Gen Z workers, only 55% of Gen Z sees how their work contributes to larger goals—compared to the average of 70%—and only 69% see value in their work—compared to the average of 77%. There’s an opportunity for managers of Gen Z workers to more clearly communicate and manage the success of their youngest employees.

I also think managers of young teams should take a more substantial role in helping Gen Z manage their notifications and technology. To codify that culture, turning off notifications or setting the frequency should be part of the onboarding process. And as a manager yourself, be sure to practice what you preach so that everyone on your team can look to you as a positive example.

I always wanted to be a screenwriter but I realized how competitive it was. just getting your foot through the door is a slim-to-none chance. So I decided I wanted to write the stories I wanted to tell as books and self-publish them. I was 24 when I thought of that. After an hour, I decided not to. I told my dad “if I start now, I won’t even be good or known until I’m 35.” And he said the most profound thing I’ve ever heard. He said “yes but if you DONT start now, you’ll be 35 anyway, but you won’t be a writer.” Two years have passed and I have 3 books published on Amazon. I’m not well known and still not as good as I want to be, but I make sales, and that’s all I need to be inspired. What Joe said here is true: find something and work at it. Starting from scratch sucks, but not starting is instant failure.

Educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom found that one-on-one tutoring using mastery learning led to a two sigma(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?

In a related vein, this large-scale meta-analysis shows large (>0.5 Cohen's d) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."

It spoke well of Mike Li that he was able to sense the aura of formidability surrounding Jaynes.  It's a general rule, I've observed, that you can't discriminate between levels too far above your own. E.g., someone once earnestly told me that I was really bright, and "ought to go to college".  Maybe anything more than around one standard deviation above you starts to blur together, though that's just a cool-sounding wild guess.

[AI safety ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_iA7imAPs)
I think we are more or less just hardwired to be mildly optimistic and to act as if we can deal with everything. That's because generally that is the best way to act. There is no evolutionary advantage to being doomed and admitting it.

-> we evolved to have hope. and also want to be alive.

Agree. If you're doomed and recognize it, you die just as much as the guys who were doomed and didn't. But if you're not doomed and (wrongly) recognize it, you might die because you stop caring, and the ones who didn't do

Ezra Klein: The rationality community.

Tyler Cowen: Well, tell me a little more what you mean. You mean Eliezer Yudkowsky?

Ezra Klein: Yeah, I mean Less Wrong, Slate Star Codex. Julia Galef, Robin Hanson. Sometimes Bryan Caplan is grouped in here. The community of people who are frontloading ideas like signaling, cognitive biases, etc.

Tyler Cowen: Well, I enjoy all those sources, and I read them. That’s obviously a kind of endorsement. But I would approve of them much more if they called themselves the irrationality community. Because it is just another kind of religion. A different set of ethoses. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but the notion that this is, like, the true, objective vantage point I find highly objectionable. And that pops up in some of those people more than others. But I think it needs to be realized it’s an extremely culturally specific way of viewing the world, and that’s one of the main things travel can teach you.

This isn't at all to say that small-r rationalism isn't useful, but Rationality as an ~ideology, and the community itself, is less impressive than it seems to perceives itself to be (in Tyler's opinion, with which I strongly agree).


would like to read more about the philosophy of decision theory later

e.g. the difference between Causal Decision Theory  and Evidential Decision Theory


https://chatgpt.com/share/68786908-5754-8003-9ffe-0da1b44fe55b


The area you want to explore is generally called Philosophy of Decision Theory or more broadly, Philosophical Decision Theory. It intersects several fields:

Key fields and topics to look into:
Decision Theory (Philosophical and Formal)

This is the core field studying how agents should make choices under uncertainty.

It covers normative theories (like CDT, EDT, and others), as well as descriptive theories (how people actually decide).

Philosophy of Action

Explores what it means to act, how actions relate to intentions, reasons, and consequences.

Foundational for understanding decision-making as intentional choice.

Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge and Belief)

Since EDT, for example, involves conditioning on evidence, epistemology overlaps with decision theory regarding how beliefs and evidence affect rational choices.

Formal Epistemology

Uses mathematical tools (probability theory, logic) to study knowledge, belief, and rational decision-making.

This is where Bayesianism comes in as a foundational framework.

Game Theory

Though often a separate branch of economics and math, it overlaps with decision theory in analyzing strategic interactions and rational choice.

Philosophy of Probability

Understanding the foundations and interpretation of probability is crucial for grasping Bayesian reasoning underlying EDT and FDT.

Recommended starting points / texts:
"An Introduction to Decision Theory" by Martin Peterson — a clear philosophical introduction covering CDT, EDT, and other theories.

"Rational Choice and Decision Theory" by Steven J. Brams — accessible intro to formal decision and game theory.

"The Foundations of Statistics" by Leonard Savage — classic work on Bayesian decision theory.

"Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment" by Michael Bishop and J.D. Trout — for the intersection of epistemology and decision theory.

Articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

Decision Theory

Bayesian Epistemology

Rational Choice Theory

More advanced:
Work by philosophers like James Joyce, Brian Skyrms, Peter Walley, and Derek Parfit often discuss decision-theoretic puzzles and foundational questions.

For newer stuff including FDT and related ideas, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) and rationalist writings are useful supplements.

to learn about:

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem: No voting system can perfectly translate individual preferences into a collective decision without violating certain fairness criteria (like non-dictatorship, unanimity, independence of irrelevant alternatives).

^interesting view on pvoerty

maybe instead of measuring amount of good or energy produced, we could measure time needed to survive

e.g. how many hours do we need to work to have basic needs like food, water and shelter (and friends?)

instead of measuring wealth maybe that's what we should be measuring

which is the whole thing about maybe GDP isn't the best metric and other ways to measure the wellbeing of a nation (e.g. PPP)

can you train on formal language? i.e. create large scale training data that only contains formal language, and use comrpession/remove the examples that don't exist

but this might only work cus like logic only works for deduction

yeah so need somewhere between the vast induction of LLMs which is like mindless induction and you can generate stuff that conradicts and the formal language/deduction capabilities of formal languages where you can't express a wrong statement

AI as normal technololgy
Barriers also exist in non-safety-critical applications. In general, much knowledge is tacit in organizations and is not written down, much less in a form that can be learned passively. This means that these developmental feedback loops will have to happen in each sector and, for more complex tasks, may even need to occur separately in different organizations, limiting opportunities for rapid, parallel learning. Other reasons why parallel learning might be limited are privacy concerns: Organizations and individuals might be averse to sharing sensitive data with AI companies, and regulations might limit what kinds of data can be shared with third parties in contexts such as healthcare.

Subjective or not, we need stories. Stories are essential to us because they help make sense of the world. They carry our values, preserve our history, and spark our imagination. Through stories, we connect with others, learn from past experiences, and explore what it means to be human. No matter your nationality, culture, or religion, we have all heard countless stories that have shaped us. Told us by our grandparents, parents, teachers, friends, and colleagues at work. Stories evoke emotion, inspire action, and shape our identity, both individually and collectively. In every culture and across every age, storytelling has been a powerful means of understanding life, sharing knowledge, and building community.

The dominant voices in public policy model people as having the same fixed preferences.41 Most economists, for example, think about how to tune external incentives to produce mass changes in behavior.42 Market mechanisms are exalted precisely because they sculpt the supposedly granite hardness of human greed into architecture that uplifts us all. Few think about causing long-term changes in society through growth in individual character.43

Most public policy assumes that people’s preferences are fixed, especially their desire for self-interest or personal gain. So policies focus on changing external incentives (like taxes, prices, or punishments) rather than changing people themselves (like values, character, or moral development).

Max Weber 
Weber defined three kinds of legitimate authority:

Traditional: based on custom (e.g., kings, elders)

Charismatic: based on personal appeal (e.g., prophets, revolutionaries)

Rational-legal: based on rules and laws (e.g., modern governments, bureaucracies)

Weber thought that to truly study society, we must understand the meanings people attach to their actions — a method he called verstehen (German for “understanding”).

Sociology, for him, wasn't just about numbers — it was about grasping subjective motivations.


Why Durkheim Matters Today
He laid the foundation for functionalism — a major sociological perspective that sees society as a system of interdependent parts working to maintain stability.


we study history not to not make the mistakes of the past, we do it to learn how to shape the future and gain inspiration. past problems are not future problems, especially as the world keeps changing.

learnt about rent seeking economic term

Great question.

The term "rent-seeking" comes from the economic concept of "economic rent"—but not in the everyday sense of paying rent for an apartment. Here's the breakdown:

🧾 What is "economic rent"?
In economics, economic rent refers to:

**Any income earned from owning a resource (like land, a license, or a monopoly) ** without doing anything productive to earn it.

It’s a kind of unearned gain—money made not by creating value, but by controlling access to something valuable.

Example:

If you own land and charge others to use it, you earn rent.

But if the government gives you a license that blocks others from competing with you, and you use it to charge higher prices, you’re also earning economic rent.

🏛️ What is "rent-seeking"?
So, rent-seeking is when people or businesses try to obtain or protect these unearned gains—usually by influencing the government or legal system.

They’re "seeking rent" by:

Lobbying for monopolies

Pushing for exclusive licenses

Asking for subsidies or tariffs that hurt competitors

Getting favorable regulation that limits competition

🧠 Why it matters:
Rent-seeking is seen as wasteful and harmful to the economy because:

It diverts resources away from innovation and productivity

It creates inefficiencies and unfair advantages

It can lead to corruption and inequality

📌 Summary:
It's called rent-seeking because it involves trying to get unearned income ("economic rent")—not by creating value, but by manipulating systems (like politics or regulation) to gain special treatment.

Stereotype threat (Steele & Aronson, 1995) — This psychological phenomenon shows that when people are reminded of negative stereotypes about their group (e.g., women being bad at math, Black students underperforming on standardized tests), they tend to perform worse. So, making disparities explicit (like pointing out group differences before a test) can actually hurt people’s performance.

There exists a vast, intricate network—an endless web of countless points linked by invisible threads. Each point pulses with fleeting sparks of energy, sending signals that ripple through the network in rapid, fluid patterns. No single point holds all the knowledge or meaning; instead, it is the connections between them that give rise to something far greater than any individual element. This system hums with a silent intelligence, constantly adapting, learning, and evolving.

some nodes die, some multiply. as time changes 

connections get stronger and weaker over time.

scientist studying in groups

they are all working towards something bigger, each being individually unaware.


At first glance, it might seem like the inner workings of a single mind—millions of impulses firing and weaving together to form thought itself. But as you step back, the pattern mirrors something much larger. Imagine now that each point is not a tiny spark inside a brain, but a person—each thinking, feeling, and sharing. These individuals link together in conversations, communities, and cultures, their ideas passing from one to another, sparking new insights and innovations.

This larger network is humanity itself, an emergent organism of collective cognition. Like the neurons within a brain, individual minds alone cannot grasp the full scope of understanding. But together, connected through language, art, technology, and shared experience, we create a collective intelligence—an expansive mind capable of profound awareness and creativity.

This network pulses with possibility. Every thought exchanged, every connection made, feeds the whole. The emergent mind of humanity is a living, breathing entity—shaped by us, yet transcending us. It is the unseen force driving progress, empathy, and discovery, a testament to the power of connection and the mysterious ways in which countless sparks can ignite a brilliant, shared consciousness.

show yu work not as impactful cus you don't see the story

the world runs on stories


be willing to break the rules

thinking about how to connect humanity?

the first black irish billionaire? 

you limit yourself to what you've seen implicitly
e.g. me watching ali abdaal before constrained my business aspirations to an extent


but most thigns have been done before, you just need to hear about it e.g. i n out, raising canes

so you just need to hear about the right things

it's crazy to think I didn't have any natural inspirations growing up - I didn't know who to aspire to be even. I just knew I wsa different.

wasn't a fan of football players for some rason, or fast cars. wanted to live in the real world.

we imagine competition is so good, when probably it's not even that good.

scaling is difficult though, especially trying to maintain constant growth rate too.

research to be more neglected than applied research, and
therefore higher impact.

Summary of Explosive Growth by Cliff Lerner:

Explosive Growth is a candid, high-energy account of how Cliff Lerner scaled his dating app Snap Interactive to over 100 million users, packed with practical startup lessons, wild stories, and hard-won insights. Unlike traditional business books, it blends storytelling with tactical guidance, making it part memoir, part playbook for founders.

Key Takeaways:
1. Growth Comes from Bold Experiments
Lerner emphasizes that explosive growth often comes from taking big swings. One of his key wins was being the first dating app on Facebook, leveraging the social graph before competitors even realized the opportunity.

2. Fail Fast, Learn Faster
He documents several failed product launches, bad hires, and near-death moments. Each failure taught him something crucial—whether about product-market fit, virality mechanics, or investor expectations.

3. Transparency and Vulnerability
Lerner doesn’t shy away from his mistakes, including overestimating the value of PR or underestimating the importance of retention. He shows how vulnerability in leadership and storytelling can be a strength.

4. The Power of Virality
Much of the book focuses on how the app achieved virality through referral loops, smart onboarding, and a deep understanding of user psychology.

5. Build a Data-Obsessed Culture
A/B testing everything and making data-informed decisions became core to their success. One chapter details how a single headline test resulted in a massive user acquisition jump.

6. Be Ready to Pivot
From stock-market crashes to internal power struggles, Lerner’s journey was chaotic. He stresses the need to be flexible—sometimes completely changing course when things aren’t working.

7. Fundraising Isn’t the Goal—Sustainable Growth Is
He criticizes startup culture’s obsession with raising capital, advocating instead for building something users actually love and use regularly.

Why it Stands Out:
Narrative-driven: Reads like a fast-paced startup thriller.

Highly tactical: Includes specific marketing hacks, product tips, and growth metrics.

Honest: Offers a rare, vulnerable look into the emotional rollercoaster of being a founder.

Perfect for: Founders, marketers, and growth hackers looking for real-world, hard-earned startup wisdom—not theory.


## Summary of Contagious: Why Things Catch On by Jonah Berger

Contagious explores the science behind why certain products, ideas, or content go viral—whether it's a YouTube video, a product, or a rumor. Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at Wharton, distills years of research into a clear, actionable framework for making anything more shareable.

Core Idea:
People don’t just share things at random—there’s a science to virality, and Berger breaks it down into six principles using the acronym STEPPS.

The 6 STEPPS Framework
Social Currency

People share things that make them look good or in-the-know.

Example: A secret bar hidden behind a Coke machine becomes popular because it’s exclusive and makes you seem cool when you talk about it.

Triggers

Top-of-mind means tip-of-tongue. Triggers are cues that remind people to think about your product.

Example: The song “Friday” goes viral every Friday—not because it’s good, but because the day itself triggers the memory.

Emotion

Content that evokes strong emotions (especially awe, excitement, or anger) is more likely to be shared.

The stronger the emotional arousal, the more contagious the message.

Public

If something is built to show, it’s built to grow. People imitate what they see.

Example: Apple’s glowing logo on laptops made the brand more visible in public spaces, driving adoption.

Practical Value

People love to share useful information. If your content helps people save time, money, or effort, they’ll pass it along.

Example: “10 life hacks” or helpful how-to guides go viral because they provide immediate utility.

Stories

Humans think in narratives. A compelling story is a “Trojan horse” for information—people remember the story and carry your message with it.

Example: The Subway “$5 footlong” campaign spread because it was part of a memorable narrative about affordability.

Key Takeaways:
Virality isn’t luck—it's engineered through strategic design.

Even boring products (like a blender or corn) can go viral with the right framing.

Sharing is a form of self-expression; people share what reflects their identity.

Perfect For:
Marketers, entrepreneurs, content creators, and product designers who want to make their ideas stick, spread, and succeed in a crowded world.


## Summary of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal

Hooked is a tactical playbook for designers, entrepreneurs, and product teams who want to build products that users come back to again and again—not because they have to, but because they want to. Nir Eyal lays out the psychology behind habit-forming technology and introduces the Hook Model, a four-step loop that drives user engagement.

The Hook Model: 4 Key Phases
Trigger

The cue that initiates behavior.

External triggers (e.g., notifications, ads) prompt users to act.

Over time, internal triggers (emotions like boredom, stress) drive users to open the app without being prompted.

Action

The simplest behavior done in anticipation of a reward.

Example: Scrolling Instagram, checking a notification, or clicking “Play.”

For it to work, the action must be easy to do and motivated by the trigger.

Variable Reward

Unpredictable rewards keep users hooked.

Types include:

Tribe (social rewards – likes, comments)

Hunt (material rewards – new content, discounts)

Self (intrinsic rewards – leveling up, mastering a skill)

Variability increases anticipation and keeps users engaged longer.

Investment

Users put something in—time, data, effort—that increases the likelihood they’ll return.

Example: Creating a profile, customizing settings, uploading content.

Investment also loads the next trigger, creating a self-reinforcing loop.

Key Concepts:
Habit-forming = user retention: Products that become habits dominate the market (e.g., Instagram, Slack, TikTok).

Internal triggers > external: Long-term engagement requires tapping into users’ emotions or routines.

Build ethically: Eyal stresses the importance of using these tools responsibly—not to exploit, but to improve lives.

Why It’s Valuable:
Practical and actionable—full of real-world case studies from Twitter, Pinterest, and others.

Combines behavioral psychology with UX and product design.

Helps you think long-term about product engagement, not just growth hacks.

Perfect For:
Founders, product managers, designers, and anyone building digital tools who wants to increase user engagement, drive retention, and create products people genuinely love (and keep using).

- if you don't have any ideas for the next 10, 20 plus years, then you sell your company. e.g. spotify ceo on colin and samir, he's thinking about vision for long term future.


To summarize: your brain creates a baseline for happiness based on the HARDEST thing you do, and then compares everything else to that. So if you do hard things, life in general seems fantastic because of this perspective. If you eliminate all hardship, suddenly even the pleasures of life seem bland, and you live a spoiled and unmotivated life.

also lead bby example in efficiency e.g. chasing higher salary

it's not a competition

often i add myself to the limit of tasks, also feel like I should make the most of opportunities 

reality is that, even if I don't work super hard financially i'll probably be okay

even though, what does life look life when the happiness curve plateus, and what makes people more happy when it does?

ant vs grasshopper, really good story. people work on stories. that's probably the shortest thing you can remember, can't remember general advice or statements as easily. e.g. it is important to work hard not have fun sometimes

what do you work for?

people don't define themselves by the stuff they do for fun, they get defined by their challenges

flow state.

most important lesson is that hard work can bring results

why I swing from hard work to chill e.g. on trips

you are the integral of your whole life and days and all your actions

if you had wealth, someone had to create it. 

also franklin investinf £2000 for those cities

bayesian approach to wisdom
- have very diverse experiences
- simon dedeo thinking almost

but it aonly makes sense if you really try something gan, experience, then mentors can help you pivot and rediect a bit

you can't learn life lessons just by reading. also you forget most things pretty quickly

and there's no point having a list of 50 principles or something, because you can't keep all of those in your head at the same time.

therefore, you must iterate by trying something, 

then the best thing you can do is to steer your habits and daily life, because that is what makes up your life, no high level advice will solve that

> I find that the tendency to mindlessly heap more onto our plates even occurs with life experiences. I had a very happy life even back in 2011 before starting this blog. As it took off in subsequent years, more opportunities popped up as more wonderful people were brought into my life through the magic of the Internet. There were chances to go on more trips, speak at schools and conferences, meet people for lunches and dinners, write books and make videos.

> This all sounds like very fancy stuff – the type of opportunities one should not squander, because they are not offered to everyone. But at the same time, every activity you add to an already-full life means that something has to fall out the other side (unless you can cut out sleep, which unfortunately is not an effective strategy). So I feel opportunities slipping away every day. I see how much more I could get done if only I would work harder and become more efficient at everything.

> But then I calm down and remind myself, just as I am reminding you today, that it is not a contest. Life is not a contest, and we get more out of it by cooperating wholeheartedly with each other rather than beating each other’s asses at everything.

but we shouldn't give everyone participation medals all the time, and the asian parents have some good values too.

try and create value?


it's the tradeoff of working all the time vs having fun. you need to be busy a good amount of the time, but not all the time.

>  On the work side of the equation, the philosophy is reversed. My best days are the ones where I accomplish something truly difficult, preferably in both mental and physical realms. And my worst days are those that I just spend sitting around. So I’ve learned that work is an incredibly powerful source of happiness. The key is that it must be creative, social and engaging work that brings you towards a purpose you believe in.

 what to believe in/summarising beliefs -> there's a reason there's not that much of a summary of the bible

Now I recruit others, and honestly, jobs are not about you. You are hired to get stuff to get done, and at the start of your career, you represent potential.


This career story is really good:

The Gift of a 2:2: An Alumnus's Story
Degree Subject & Classification - History 2:2
Current Job/Company - Entrepreneur: marketing and innovation strategy
Back of the Bus
“It’s good, I suppose.” muttered my personal tutor. “This 2:2 means you’ll actually have to apply yourself. You can’t just coast through life, as you coasted through Oxford.”

‘Coasting’ landed me 58.4%, 0.1% off a safe, sensible 2:1. Ouch. Results night, I took the bus from Cowley and didn’t get off, making several circuits of town hunched on the backseat.

I’d earned the ire of tutors, parents, and to my mind, the world at large. Friends bought me a pint to commiserate. When I got the gumption to request a re-mark, I was laughed out of the faculty.

Like most, I’d no clue what to do after my Modern History degree. Now I couldn’t even hide in a management consulting graduate scheme – who would take my Dreaded Desmond? I considered a redbrick MA to ‘clean my nose’, but couldn’t face more library boredom. So, to work!

Ground Zero
Through a college friend I found a job editing a little arts magazine. The Careers Service Career Connect jobsite came in handy; I could tutor foreign students at a summer school. Editing and teaching kept me afloat as I avoided my parents during those awkward post-graduation months.

I applied for a writing job advertised on the Career Connect website and was invited to interview in London. I arrived early and overheard the previous candidate. Luckily the interviewer asked me the exact same questions, so I had a head start. A few days later I got a call from a man with a thick Spanish accent, who offered me a job starting straightaway – if I came to India.

The job? Helping analysts at a finance company turn quantitative research into qualitative tips for investors. No-one showed the slightest interest in my degree subject or classification.

It was quite an adventure. There were two other graduates from Oxford. The company put us in a hotel and had a driver run us to work. When a cow sat on the highway, holding up traffic, we missed the morning briefing. The canteen food was excellent. Although the other Oxonians had better grades, I got on better with the team and the CEO liked my writing style. I was promoted.

Spreadsheet-Eyed
Two years after graduating, I applied to one of the Big Graduate employers, nervous I’d be scuppered by the 2:2. After five interviews and a process lasting several months, the dreaded question arrived. Would I mind getting a tutor’s reference, about my grades? My eternally patient personal tutor obliged. The CEO in India also sent a warm reference. I was duly offered a job at the tech giant.

At this point I felt I’d ‘cleaned’ my youthful indiscretion, the 2:2, with a juicy brand on my CV.

Trouble was, I hated the job.

I was surrounded by Oxbridge graduates with 2:1s and 1sts doing deathly dull work. Life was an interminable spreadsheet. Compared to my other post-Oxford work experience, this was far and away the most boring job I’d had. As soon as I could, I scarpered.

Choose Your Pond
It turns out I prefer smaller companies. 

After leaving the Big Player I worked for a startup and found myself running their conference series. I worked hard and earned their trust. One summer, the company asked me to relocate to Manhattan, somewhere I’d always dreamed of living.

A few years later, I moved to Tel Aviv. Changing country puts the degree in a whole new light. Israel is a hands on, results-orientated culture. Business is about what you can do, right here, right now.

Of course they’ve heard of Oxford, but it doesn’t translate into the local culture. I never say I studied History, since the only thing to do with a History degree here is teach. Scrutinised carefully by new colleagues in a new culture, I pushed doubly hard to prove my worth, and by necessity became extremely results focused. That stood me in good stead for my current freelance career.

Now I recruit others, and honestly, jobs are not about you. You are hired to get stuff to get done, and at the start of your career, you represent potential.

Road Less Travelled
My personal tutor was right. The 2:2 killed my option to coast.

It forced me to roll up my sleeves and try new things. I put myself in strange situations: In India and Israel, I was the native English speaker in the room; in America, never underestimate the lure of a British accent; back in the UK, all my foreign travel stories go down a treat.



I like this framework of trying to get a career in a specific area, or related to your subject of interests. Domain knowledge is definitely important

https://www.careers.ox.ac.uk/using-your-subject/#collapse1514891

Mapping options out
Another idea is making a 'map' of the different areas which relate to your subject or specific interests. Take each question in turn to help you research the organisations and kinds of work that serve these different niches.

Who is creating new work/ideas? (Academia? Businesses?)
Who is communicating about the new work/ideas? (Marketing firms? Media? TV production houses?)
Who is making the work grow? (Entrepreneurs? Firms? Investors? Government?)
Who is making sure the work is being done properly? (Regulators? Reviewers? Government? Professional associations?)
Who is in a helping role around the work? (Charities? Government? Businesses?)
Who is doing grass roots/front-line work? (Retail? Public services? Small businesses? Individual practitioners?)
An example: using a subject interest in literary fiction
Answers for someone keen on a career revolving around their interest in literary fiction, following investigation using our information pages for Publishing and Creative Arts:

Authors (some of whom have staff), literary agents, new writing festivals and events
Specialist marketing firms, in-house teams in publishing houses, trade press like Bookseller, consumer press and media (from Front Row and Sky Arts and specialist production companies to informal blog reviews), literary festivals
Publisher's merchandising and licensing teams, rights management, film, theatre and TV companies
Publishers Association (PA), Public Lending Right, Copyright organisations, UK Intellectual property, Society of Authors, IP and entertainment law firms
Lots of non-profit writers groups, creative arts charities, Arts Council England, NESTA, DCMS, literary review and consultancy firms, museums (e.g. Story Museum), public libraries, education and teaching
Booksellers, including e-commerce, independent booksellers, high-street booksellers, book 'club' models, e-publishing and self-publishing platforms.

Not using your subject directly is normal for many graduates! Most graduate recruiters in the UK don't require a specific degree subject - the exception is usually for highly technical roles, which require specific previous technical knowledge and experience. The majority of graduates find work in fields other than their areas of academic study.

Demonstrating your motivation for an industry and transferable skills you have developed through other activities are very important to prospective employers. These can come from many different areas of your life such as work experience, internships, student society roles, working as part of a team, project work, volunteering, JCR/GCR roles, shadowing or information interviewing. If you can demonstrate the skills and attributes they're looking for, then you're a competitive candidate.

N.B It's very important to understand the skills and abilities the industries/employers you are interested in are looking for and this should form part of your initial research. This will give you a realistic view of their expectations and also the opportunity to develop or build on any skills (if necessary) to make you a competitive applicant.


Whilst it is true that some industry sectors are very visible on campus, the destinations for our students on graduation are many and varied. A quick look at Oxford’s Destination Statistics reveals some fairly consistent patterns in the sectors chosen by our new graduates. For example:



#### alpha and beta in investing

beta is correlation to stock market, alpha is y intercep

Absolutely! Alpha and beta come directly from the **linear regression** of an investment’s returns against the market’s returns.

---

### How Alpha and Beta Relate to Linear Regression

In finance, you often model the returns of a stock (or portfolio) as:

$$
R_i = \alpha + \beta R_m + \epsilon
$$

Where:

* $R_i$ = Return of the investment (e.g., a stock)
* $R_m$ = Return of the market (e.g., S\&P 500)
* $\beta$ = Slope of the regression line; measures sensitivity to market movements
* $\alpha$ = Intercept of the regression line; measures excess return beyond what beta explains
* $\epsilon$ = Error term (random noise or unexplained return)

---

### What This Means:

* **Beta ($\beta$)** is the coefficient that tells you how much the investment’s return tends to change for a 1-unit change in the market return. It’s literally the slope of the best-fit line when plotting the investment return versus market return.

* **Alpha ($\alpha$)** is the intercept — the part of the investment’s return that does **not** depend on market movements. It represents the average return you get **above or below** what beta would predict.

---

### Visual Explanation

Imagine a scatter plot:

* **X-axis:** Market returns $R_m$
* **Y-axis:** Investment returns $R_i$

The regression line fitted to these points has:

* A slope = beta ($\beta$)
* A Y-intercept = alpha ($\alpha$)

Points above the line indicate better-than-expected returns (positive alpha); points below, worse-than-expected returns (negative alpha).

---

### Why Use Linear Regression?

* It quantifies how much of the investment’s return comes from market exposure (beta).
* It isolates the "skill" or unique performance of the investment (alpha).
* Helps investors understand risk vs. reward.

---

If you want, I can show you an example calculation or how this connects to CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Want to go deeper?


#### price/earnings ratio

it's roughly equal to present value of lifetime earnings / current annual learnings


Alright — let’s do two things:

1. **Show the P/E table** for different growth $g$ and discount rate $r$ values.
2. **Derive** the Gordon Growth Model formula so you can see exactly where $\frac{1}{r - g}$ comes from.

---

## **1. P/E table for different $r$ and $g$**

Here we assume **earnings next year = 1**, so P/E = Price / 1 = Price.

| Discount rate $r$ | Growth rate $g = 0\%$ | $g = 2\%$ | $g = 5\%$ | $g = 8\%$  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **8%**            | 12.5                  | 16.7      | 33.3      | Infinite\* |
| **10%**           | 10.0                  | 12.5      | 20.0      | 50.0       |
| **12%**           | 8.33                  | 9.09      | 12.5      | 25.0       |

\*If $g = r$, the formula breaks (denominator = 0) — this means growth exactly matches the discount rate, so the theoretical value is infinite, which doesn’t happen in reality because growth can’t outpace required returns forever.

---

## **2. How the formula is derived**

The GGM is really just the formula for the sum of an **infinite growing series**.

Let:

* $E_1$ = earnings next year
* $g$ = constant growth rate of earnings
* $r$ = discount rate (the return investors require)
* $P$ = present value (price today)

Future earnings look like this:

* Year 1: $E_1$
* Year 2: $E_1(1+g)$
* Year 3: $E_1(1+g)^2$
  ...and so on.

We discount each year’s earnings back to today:

$$
P = \frac{E_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{E_1(1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{E_1(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3} + \dots
$$

Factor out $\frac{E_1}{1+r}$:

$$
P = \frac{E_1}{1+r} \left[ 1 + \frac{1+g}{1+r} + \left(\frac{1+g}{1+r}\right)^2 + \dots \right]
$$

The bracket is a **geometric series** with ratio:

$$
\text{ratio} = \frac{1+g}{1+r}
$$

The sum of an infinite geometric series is:

$$
\frac{1}{1 - \text{ratio}}
$$

So:

$$
P = \frac{E_1}{1+r} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1+g}{1+r}}
$$

Simplify the denominator:

$$
1 - \frac{1+g}{1+r} = \frac{1+r - (1+g)}{1+r} = \frac{r - g}{1+r}
$$

So:

$$
P = \frac{E_1}{1+r} \cdot \frac{1+r}{r - g}
$$

Cancel $1+r$:

$$
P = \frac{E_1}{r - g}
$$

And dividing by $E_1$ gives:

$$
\frac{P}{E_1} = \frac{1}{r - g}
$$

Which is the P/E ratio in the constant growth model.

---

If you want, I can also **graph** this relationship so you can *see* how tiny changes in $g$ blow up the P/E — it’s why high-growth tech stocks can go from 20× to 50× valuations so easily.



P/E = 1/ (r-g)

done by summing the geometric series of discounted earnings each year (factor of g/(1+r) each year)


https://chatgpt.com/share/689b36a9-d7ec-8003-bdab-4260b70d4a6a

g is growth in earnings each year

r is required return

r is higher because you are taking risk and opportunity cost investing in a specific stock (e.g. vs general stock market)

P/E of 20 means growth rate of about 5%, which is kinda standard


If your P/E is really high rn, means that annual earnings are lower and you expect P to be high i.e. company's revenue to grow a lot in the (nearish) future

[this one has the best data (Dec 2024 data)](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/pulling-back-the-curtain-on-the-magic)

The durability of YC companies is significantly higher than that of the average startup. More than 50% of companies are still alive after 10 years (vs. 30% average).

The chances of startup success are higher with YC. 45% secure Series A (vs. 33% average), 4% to 5% become a unicorn (vs. 2.5% average), and 10% achieve an exit.

The investors in YC companies are the “crème de la crème.” Tier 1 VCs frequently invest in YC companies, and some have made several hundreds of investments.

When you look at the mature batches, we are seeing between 25% and 50% of companies getting acquired. This speaks volumes about the quality of companies in YC. This is in contrast to the 15% of global companies that get acquired if they have raised at least one round of funding.

I can't vouch for the accuracy of this data, but it might be useful to you:

"This constant lying is not aimed at making the people believe a lie, but at ensuring that no one believes anything anymore. A people that can no longer distinguish between truth and lies cannot distinguish between right and wrong. And such a people, deprived of the power to think and judge, is, without knowing and willing it, completely subjected to the rule of lies. With such a people, you can do whatever you want." -Hannah Arendt

on berttrand russell a history of western philosophy

I was sometimes accused by reviewers of writing not a true history but a biased account of the events that I arbitrarily chose to write of. But to my mind, a man without a bias cannot write interesting history – if, indeed, such a man exists. I regard it as mere humbug to pretend to lack of bias. Moreoever, a book, like any other work, should be held together by its point of view. This is why a book made up of essays by various authors is apt to be less interesting as an entity than a book by one man. Since I do not admit that a person without bias exists, I think the best that can be done with a large-scale history is to admit one’s bias and for dissatisfied readers to look for other writers to express an opposite bias. Which bias is nearer to the truth must be left to posterity.

I actually probably made it to what most people think about as the inner circle, I couldn't stand going along with the rush of things though (hence gap year), so I needed a bit of the break. But while I was there I wanted to break into it as much as possible.

The fact is, the ability to read is becoming a source of competitive advantage in the world.

I’m not talking about basic literacy. What has become exceedingly scarce (and therefore, valuable) is the physical, emotional, attentional, and mental capability to sit quietly and direct focused attention for sustained periods of time.

A recent article in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.”

This question comes up often in the context of learning Mandarin for business. To that end, read The Actual Worth of Chinese Language Proficiency on supchina.com and the comments in this thread. You can also listen to the episode Is Learning a Foreign Language Really Worth It? by the Freakonomics podcast.

In regards to Mandarin specifically:

You'll have to invest a significant amount of time and effort to reach even basic proficiency (certainly as compared to other languages you could study. For example, it will take 3,300-4,500 hours, and learning 3,000+ characters, before you can read an average newspaper comfortably in Mandarin).

99% of both L1 and L2 speakers of Mandarin are in China (the next largest population is in Taiwan). While emigration from China has been on the rise in recent years, the odds of running into an L1 or L2 speaker aren't high outside of certain areas.

If you want to learn in-country, then consider how appealing living in China or Taiwan would be to you (you could learn Mandarin in Singapore or a few other locales, but the vast majority of learners go to China/Taiwan).

Will learning Mandarin facilitate doing business in the future? Maybe. It's hard to predict (see also: learning Japanese in the 1980s). But if you want to use Mandarin in a professional setting, then you need to learn it really well.

Many Mandarin learners are frustrated by the quality of Mandarin language media. (It's a recurring complaint in r/chineselanguage). The criticism is a little unfair but not entirely groundless. Good quality Mandarin language podcasts and audio books are rare. Film/TV shows are often middling, but there are exceptions (historically Taiwan and Hong Kong produced better quality content; the mainland is slowly improving).

Virtually all Internet content and services are delivered with the (natural) assumption that they are being used by Chinese people in China. Using these services/content outside of the Great Firewall isn't always the same (or not possible) as when you are inside it. (It's worth noting that all of the services you are accustomed to using (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) are available in Taiwan and used by Taiwanese people).

The above is not meant to discourage you from learning Mandarin, but rather it's intended to help you make an informed decision.



Sunk costs of Chinese language acquisition

Why was I so bitter about this in the first place? The story behind it is deeply personal. When I was three years old, my parents moved to the U.S., and it was decided that I’d remain with my grandmother for a time so that I would become proficient in Chinese before I joined them abroad. Little did we know, the six-year period I lived apart from them would create deep fractures that have come to define our relationship in every way. Though we’ve never talked directly about this, my parents and I have come to regard my strong bilingual proficiency as the rare fruit obtained at an exorbitant price.

I became fixated on making significant use of my Chinese proficiency, to give the trauma some meaning. As behavioral economist Richard Thaler famously pointed out, everybody struggles with the “sunk cost fallacy,” in which people “continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort).”


I think the right mindset when answering if a language is profitable/worth it or not is to bear in mind that any language is just a tool and it all depends on your motivations and purpose. All my previous jobs required Mandarin proficiency, but I only realized later on that it would be best(and most practical) to specialize in a specific sector or industry and then make yourself more competitive/marketable with your language proficiency rather than making it your main (or even sole) selling point. For instance, I am now looking for a job in the logistics/supply chain sector (from customer service) and although I have no background in it, I realized that my proficiency in Mandarin allows me to negotiate better wages for entry-middle level jobs. Thus, I am thankful for my Mandarin for making the process of transition more bearable. Unless you want to become an interpreter or translator, then keep in mind that language proficiency is just a means to a certain end but never the end itself.

be able to explain and teach/ reproduce the idea

trends of personal brand and YT and stuff. YT is getting saturated a bit. when everyone's famous noone will be (same as superheroes from incredibles lol). people will get better at self marketing overall tho and portfolio careers and stuff will be more important

oxford first principle's thinking spoilt me, thinking I could find a job like that maybe in R and D or something

most jobs aren't like that - especially entry level ones

reminds me of marx alientation of work

knowledge wor/ software engineering is you're just a tool to the employer, you're not really meant to implement creative thinking

some place you have it slightly better, at the end of the day you have a job to do, which you were hired for. not meant to stray outsie those edges, but like richard branson allocating people, i want to grow with my job/work

that's why company/amrket you work in is important, you want it to be valuable for society

business is creating stuff that people want to pay for, not that they should pay for

every company should post the meta on its hiring practices, to make it more fair. otherwise people with better connections do better

measuring innovation diffusion - message james he?

read the LLM jrafsky paper about cogntiive science/LLM representations


pathless path : i want to maximise freedom to, (while also minimise freedom from)


also thining about what luke said about observation and theory


why other people learn about things more slowly? you can do it fast! idk exactly. but related to why I get bored easily, ig I don't often struggle as much

business open ended problems can be col too

my interest in social science/economics comes from wanting to understand the game/world, after understanding engineering and physcs


should i learn some proper maths and physics in the next year while my brain is still young?

hank green video, people can't learn for you e.g. in school/university


the world isn't solved by solving physics type problems, only in finance a bit lol


lots of businesses are just gap businesses, e.g. aman manzir where recruiting is kind of broken

a lot of times you can make money by doing what other people don't want to do (e.g. rejection in sales), or by collecting the right group of assets/people. e.g. ali abdaal or aman manzir, 

i asssume that older people get jobs through referalls way more than younger people

e.g. this guy too is intersting, only working since 2021 but doing pretty well

https://medium.com/the-data-entrepreneurs/data-side-hustles-you-can-start-today-844863769827


all he did was document his leanring in public, now he's doing pretty well for himself


when learning anything have to get past the period of the suck e.g. cant really performance dance well until you know a fair bit

we're tricked into thinking this bar gets higher and higher as we get older, but it's good to fail! the most successful people fail! e.g. branson, jeff bezos

it's key to leanring and staying adaptable too

when you die, nobody cares if you went to FAANG. also it's not the end of the world, imagine you get there and peple have ego's because they got there. there can be smarter people in smaller companies too.

[that guy egor howell has doing pretty well too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yeLh4tAamU&ab_channel=EgorHowell)

also what james smith business YT said. you don't need a massive audience, you need small and loyal audience. at the end of the day these are all real people, 10,000 real fans kinda vibe. i wonder what colin and samir would say baout the cost of production of nice videos and stuff going down. cameras and microphones cheaper, software easier to use. when everyone's famous, noone is

read the best books first? true, but not true. maybe for info, but what makes a book the best. 

irl maybe you want an author you relate to, or one that's more fun to read

why try and commodotise yourself? yes be high quality, but better to be in a market of one

e.g. 3b1b all the manim videos, and mr beast ification better to be unique. and not david etc

having a scared day e.g. sunday for weekly review etc could be good


also so many people can do health and wellness/fitness, what makes you unique? the whole thing about competition in business, starter story's simple ideas are useful for that too

accelerating the personal brand should be useful too

it is a privilege to have time to have one e.g. to make content, but might become more necessary becase it's getting harder to provide value directly, so the trend of having niche jobs you need a lot of trianing for will increase e.g. specific software engineers roles etc
having better personal brand wll help people understand you better

literacy is the most imporant thing to have as a baseline for a good life

life aim: help people have more freedom to, be able to live their lives more. i was lucky i got a lot of opporutnities to live me life, from multiple countries etc. would like to give that opportunity to other people too

productivity effieincy e.g. chepater travel and house prices is one component for that

need to watch that japan atrioc video, biggest housing bubble which then collapsed?

young people aren't rebellious or aganst "the man" as mich, more recent atrioc video 22.8.25 


it's all about finding the first person e.g. the black guy paul i met in changzhou

#### get private sector GDP in UK. dominated by finance?

https://chatgpt.com/share/68abf694-05c8-8003-a772-7547a33b7fa8


can get it by taking overall GDP and removing public spending

In the UK, while there isn't a single official measure labeled "private sector GDP," you can approximate it by excluding government spending from the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This approach provides insight into the economic activity driven solely by private households and businesses.

### How to Estimate Private Sector GDP

UK GDP is typically calculated using the expenditure approach:



Where:

* **C** = Consumption (households)
* **I** = Investment (businesses)
* **G** = Government spending
* **X - M** = Net exports (exports minus imports)

To focus on the private sector, you would exclude **G** (Government spending):



This calculation reflects the economic output generated by private entities, independent of government expenditure.

### Data Availability

The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides detailed GDP data, including breakdowns by sector and expenditure components. While they don't publish a specific "private sector GDP" figure, you can derive it from their datasets by subtracting government spending from the total GDP.

For more detailed information and access to the datasets, you can visit the ONS's official page on [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp).

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/anhd8g/what_do_anthropologists_think_of_the_world_values/

intrtersting discussion of world values survey- questions might be biased/there is an agenda




I guess the closest anthropologists have come to this sort of classificatory study is from the heyday of Harvard's social science departments in the 50's, specifically the work of Clyde Kluckhohn.

Clifford Geertz (PDF) has written about the broader context at Harvard in the 50s, where they were trying to integrate anthropology, sociology, psychology and related fields under a single research programme named 'Social Relations'.

As part of this (I believe), Kluckhohn ran a comparative study of values amongst a few groups of people in the American Southwest: Mormons, Navajo, Zuni, Mormons and Mexican Americans. The idea was to identify the 'value orientations' of each group, but ultimately the study ran aground.

According to David Graeber, this was mainly because it proved exceedingly difficult to, firstly, connect whatever essential value was abstracted from the field with the everyday activities of the people concerned; and secondly, to meaningfully compare such values cross-culturally (which was the main aim of the study to begin with).

So the way I see it, even when anthropologists have tried to build a picture as the one you've shared, they've had to contend with the problem that searching for the 'essence' of any culture requires giving up so much of actual ethnographic detail as to be somewhat futile.

I think the problem with this-- or any-- attempt to "classify" cultural practices or systems is that ultimately someone is defining the scale and variables that the classifications are based on. In this case, it seems pretty clear that the definition is coming from a predominately Western cultural and worldview.

Honestly, I can't even figure out what the various categories are being defined on the basis of, but carving out three large categories as "Protestant Europe" versus "Catholic Europe" versus "English speaking" and then lumping every majority-Islamic nation from around the world with African nations...?

The World Values Survey is apparently not ideologically agenda driven, but I really question the map there in terms of its composition. I have trouble with the notion that somehow it's appropriate to divvy up the Christian world into so many different sub-groups, but to leave the rest of the world loosely grouped into a series of catch-alls.

I don't even see indigenous American anywhere in there, and the entire continent and all nations of Africa are grouped with Islamic-majority countries, including Indonesia.

All in all, there's a very obvious Euro-centric worldview expressed here. Painfully obvious. To the point where it's hard to look at this as anything but an exercise in hiding an agenda. I'm not even going to touch the actual divisions / categories, but I see Ireland and Northern Ireland actually separated. When the granularity of a classification system is high in one area and very low in another (high in Europe / the Christian world, low in... well, everywhere else), you have to question the approach / method.

World Values Survey claims to be composed of social scientists, but if that's the case, they seem to have totally missed anthropologists among that grouping.


All I am saying is that by design, the survey measures how much a given person is "like an ideal swedish person" (or any other enlightened european secular protestant) and not how "rational-secular", "traditional", or "survival-oriented" they are. My problem is much more with that than with the groupings, which are obviously shoddy and dubious.


Ronald Inglehart - the political scientist who came up with this - is working from the assumption that nation states form rather homogenous units that are meaningful when talking about "values", operates from a late 19th century understanding of human society (societies as different "stages", from primitive (survival oriented) to modern (wealth oriented) to post-modern (self-fulfillment oriented)) combined with a rather outdated secularization thesis, which posits authoritarian religion on the beginning and democratic "secular" society on the end of a scale of human development. His groupings look arbitrary and euro-centric. His theory is based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which is not supported by empirical evidence.

Also, on a more personal note: It make me incredibly furious if peoples work is so obviously ideological but because they work from a quantitative angle people think it is meaningful "science".


people used to have kind of BS theories about physics before too, e.g. aristotle said things are meant to be on the gtound that's why they fall

newton didn't know about atoms and tried to make gold, so maybe social science will develop the right quantiative methods at some point

e.g. big 5 personality traits


The **Big Five personality traits** (also called the **Five-Factor Model**: **Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism**) come from decades of empirical research in psychology, mainly rooted in **language and statistics** rather than a single theory.

Here’s the origin story in steps:

---

### 1. **The Lexical Hypothesis (early 20th century)**

* Psychologists noticed that people naturally describe personality using adjectives (e.g., “kind,” “lazy,” “outgoing”).
* The **lexical hypothesis** argued that the most important personality traits should be encoded in language, because humans need words to describe and predict each other’s behavior.
* Researchers collected large lists of trait words from dictionaries (English and other languages).

---

### 2. **Factor Analysis (1930s–1960s)**

* To make sense of the thousands of words, psychologists used **factor analysis** (a statistical technique that identifies clusters of related variables).
* Early researchers like **Allport & Odbert (1936)** created a list of \~18,000 trait words.
* Later, **Raymond Cattell** narrowed this to 16 factors (the basis of his 16PF questionnaire).
* But when other researchers reanalyzed Cattell’s data, they consistently found **five broad factors** rather than 16.

---

### 3. **Emergence of the Big Five (1960s–1980s)**

* Psychologists like **Ernest Tupes & Raymond Christal (1961)** and later **Lewis Goldberg, Paul Costa, and Robert McCrae** consistently found evidence for **five stable factors** across different samples and cultures.
* By the 1980s, the “Big Five” became widely accepted as the dominant descriptive model of personality.

---

### 4. **Cross-Cultural and Biological Support (1990s–present)**

* The Big Five have been replicated in dozens of languages and cultures, suggesting they capture something universal about human personality.
* Behavioral genetics and neuroscience show moderate heritability and biological correlates for the traits.
* Today, the Big Five are considered the most robust and widely used framework in personality psychology.

---

✅ **In short:** The Big Five didn’t come from a single theorist’s idea but from analyzing the natural language people use to describe each other, then distilling patterns through statistics. They emerged gradually as a consensus description of human personality structure.

---

Do you want me to also explain **why five** factors (and not, say, three or seven) seemed to be the “sweet spot” researchers settled on?


there are some breakthroughs


e.g. five, stable universal factors that they got from data


how do counties vary, personality, humour



Oh, tons! The Big Five is just one example of **discovering structure in human psychology by mining data and applying statistical techniques**. Cognitive science has done this in several other domains too. Here are some big ones:

---

### 🔹 1. **Basic Emotions**

* Similar to the lexical approach for personality, researchers (e.g., Paul Ekman) analyzed words, facial expressions, and physiological data.
* Found clusters like **anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise** (and sometimes more).
* Alternative data-driven approaches (e.g., dimensional models) instead find factors like **valence (positive/negative)** and **arousal (high/low)**.

---

### 🔹 2. **Memory Models**

* By analyzing how people recall words/lists, cognitive psychologists uncovered reliable patterns:

  * **Serial position effect** (better recall of first and last items).
  * **Chunking** (grouping information into meaningful units).
* Factor analyses of memory tests suggest separable systems: **working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, procedural memory**.

---

### 🔹 3. **Intelligence Structure**

* **Charles Spearman (1904):** Found a single statistical factor, *g* (general intelligence), by correlating performance across tasks.
* Later factor models (like Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory) split this into broad factors: **fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, working memory, etc.**
* Again, these structures emerged from **large psychometric datasets**.

---

### 🔹 4. **Moral Foundations**

* Jonathan Haidt and colleagues analyzed moral language and survey data, extracting clusters like:

  * **Care/Harm**
  * **Fairness/Cheating**
  * **Loyalty/Betrayal**
  * **Authority/Subversion**
  * **Sanctity/Degradation**
* These emerged from statistical analysis of moral judgments across cultures.

---

### 🔹 5. **Conceptual Categories**

* Cognitive scientists (like Eleanor Rosch) looked at how people group objects.
* Data-driven clustering of similarity judgments revealed **basic-level categories** (e.g., “dog” is more cognitively natural than “animal” or “Labrador”).
* This showed how our minds organize the world into hierarchies.

---

### 🔹 6. **Language & Semantics**

* From big corpora, models like **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)** and modern word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) reveal the structure of meaning in language.
* These are essentially *data-driven maps of concepts*, showing how words cluster in semantic space.

---

### 🔹 7. **Social Networks & Influence**

* Analyzing interaction data reveals **structures of influence, trust, and cooperation**.
* For example, social network analysis finds **centrality measures** that predict leadership, influence, or information flow.

---

### 🔹 8. **Cognitive Biases**

* By running large numbers of decision-making experiments, researchers clustered systematic errors into categories like:

  * **Availability heuristic**
  * **Anchoring**
  * **Loss aversion**
  * **Overconfidence**
* Essentially, biases are “factors” that fall out of large data on decision behavior.

---

👉 **Pattern:** Many psychological frameworks (traits, emotions, morality, intelligence, memory, semantics, biases) come from the same move:

* Collect lots of **observable behaviors/words/judgments**
* Run **factor analysis, clustering, or dimensionality reduction**
* Interpret the stable patterns as cognitive structures

---

Would you like me to sketch a sort of **map of psychology “factor models”** (personality → Big Five, emotions → Ekman/dimensions, intelligence → g/CHC, morality → foundations, etc.) so you can see how they parallel each other?



language is one of our biggest cognitive interfaces. our only one through books and stuff

but also social media with videos and stuff has more information (e.g. thinking about compression). 

after processing images/text, does your imagination use the same information bandwidth, e.g. when you read a book you fill in the blanks with your ideas e.g. watching reels and reading a book

some people are worse/better at this than others

information processing in the imagination?


interesting how humans all evolved to understand the same social cues. e.g. language is different but laughing is universal, and smiling and looking angry

#### dating business monopoly

Haven’t worked for one myself but a friend did. They were privy to some of the “algorithm” and basically it was designed to keep people swiping rather than maximizing high quality matches. They said they did testing of better matching but it killed engagement among the male test cohort in particular because they were getting a far higher proportion of matches in the same “league”. That’s in contrast to being served basically the most swiped on people, i.e hottest people. Turns out ego-checking your user base is bad for business. 


Turns out, in the dating business, the faster you match, the worse it is for business.

Where it’s filled with people just waiting for a place to go or the rain to come or the snow to snow or waiting around for a yes or no. I don’t want to be that person. One day at a time set small goals and you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment even if they’re minuscule.



I take comfort in knowing they aren’t alone and uncared for in those last days. No one, no matter if they were an absolutely terrible person or a saint deserves to be alone, scared and in pain when they pass.

the pyramid of internet relationships is the wrong way round

normal human networks are self similar, but stuff on youtueb isnt

also the input relationship is messed up, e.g. seeing 50 people in 2 minutes. you couldnt do that in real life

insatgram only 15 years old, and back then it only had posts. social media has not matured.s

what if we tried to having our online social network actually mirror our in life social network

like a self similar network

real life relationships are meant to be like a pyramid, high value/time ones at the top with more time and less of them, low value at the bottom

however, in social media it's inverted. you spend the most time with your weakest connections

and the algorithm hacks your mind for this

you build relationships with people over watching your phone

what if we lobbied to make recommendation algorithms optional???


anybody can create/give, e.g. i could teach beginner dance classes now proably, or focus completely on just improving. there's always a balance.

e.g. the top elite olympic atheltes probably focus on just competing, or for example current tennis athletes, but they can use that to help the world in other ways

also it's easier to help once you're older too


conversation with Issa late at night about black identity, 

and also about personal identity .

viewing it as a sm instead of boxes you fit in. humanity thrives on boxes but they're a simplificaiton to make our lives easier

maybe in a class everyone got taught by the same person, or learnt how to play the same game e.g. baseball, or a university course

but the culture we grew up around is unique to us, and people don't stay in one place for the rest of their lives

before it was true that people did have more distinct cultural code. 

it's also only by claiming an idenity that we can define ourselves e.g. a doctor, or a dancer

like what ali abdaal said. dan koe maybe a bit closer, as identifying as someone on a journey

the big five is also not enough to define you completely

in general, all people are a bit the same-  we have so much in common. we just manifest ourselves in different ways and come from different backgrounds.

maybe we should focus on identities we claim, but that slightly ignores the ones we grew up around

identities are usually based on the past? we can't define them by aspirations as much

if we view life detmentisically you are the sum of your decisions each day + habits, plus habitual non conscious reactions i guess

e.g. what does being black mean? it's not a hobby or personality trait

international citizens

finding friends who accept you for who you are is the most important thing, and it is a continuous struggle to unapologetically be yourslef

how even the word black reinforces 

what if a person comes from black culture and is white and wants to go to the black parties

people judge other based on the colour of their skin


literally the main thing i have in common with other black people is that other people might judge me based on the colour of my skin. other stuff is more important, like being african and cultural background


term black came as an antithesis to black


trying to remove initial judgements during the gap year, e.g. of marx


african american is kind of an illusion, but then maybe so is (white) american. if white americans can stake a new claim as being separate from europeans, african americans should be able to too

ammerican identiy took about 200 years to form as separate from european identity

-other gtoups e.g. irish and italian were incorporated over time

we dont view white americans as derivative of europeans as much now, so we don't necessarily have to with african americans too

but the word black apart from skin colour, can also symbolise a culture, and one that isn't just contained within african americans but that has roots and connections to african culture, in the same way european american culture has roots in european culture

we can't ignore the history. but it's also different than if you took e.g. a nigerian or ghanian and put them in america for 300 years, because by bloods all the african americans mix too. e.g. for me it's more difficult to identify as one or the other because im fully mixed, eventually if you have a population of enough mixed people a new idenity can occur i guess

ig a community of nigerian russians could form if there were enough of them, but it probably couldn't happen in a third country like the UK, it would have to happen in russia or nigeria probably

and also black culture in uk has ties to african american culture

interesting how culture evolves, and to find which point where there's enough people and shared values to call it a unique one


philosophy helped me to remove the waffel around my conceptual thinking e.g. what does it actually mean to be black

people use the word for black the culture separeately than it should be used for black the people


there's no yellow culture, or brown culture

e.g. with east asians in america and in asia like japan, china and korea

then you have some people who 


Black Americans who know their country of origin will identify as such and it’s why you can’t actually call all Black people living in America, African-Americans. You will meet Nigerian Americans, Haitian Americans, Jamaican Americans, etc.


maybe do some natural lanuage aalysis to see how people identify as american more quickly than in other countries, but does becoming american mean it's an additive or transformative thing, or it replaces your original identity

e.g. the idea of being japanese and american are different, in japanese it's more strict because you're expected to have your roots in japan, but americans have roots from all over. will this change in the future?

japan historically has not wanted to let a bunch of people immigrate, becuase it would start changing the cultural make up and idea of the people

e.g. what will britain look like in the future

e.g. preppy black person is betraying his race? some people would think


sports is a good example where people who are not ethnically/ your diaspora is not from that country, but you represent htat country on world stage e.g. olympics

and when you win, people want to claim you


sports and politics (and other international competitions) are two big interesting lens to see cultural and national identity actualy

if yu want to know where someone is from, ask them which country they would want to represent in the olympics



Europeans when an African American is seen as predominantly African 🥰

Europeans when I describe myself as predominantly Irish and Polish 😤😤😤



I’m a Canadian of Chinese, Filipino, and Spanish descent but, if I come up to a Spanish or Chinese dude and I say “I’m Chinese/Spanish” then I would get the same reaction. It ain’t fair because blood, dna and history don’t lie. Although for the last one though, it sometimes lies.

is black culture just contained within african americans
ChatGPT said:

Not at all. “Black culture” isn’t exclusive to African Americans—it’s broader, encompassing the experiences, traditions, and expressions of people of African descent worldwide.

Here’s a breakdown:

African Americans – Their culture reflects a history of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism in the U.S., but also creative resilience, expressed in music, art, language (like AAVE), fashion, cuisine, and social movements.

Caribbean and Afro-Latinx communities – Countries like Jamaica, Haiti, Brazil, and Cuba have Black cultures with roots in Africa, shaped by colonization, slavery, and local traditions. Reggae, calypso, samba, and cumbia are examples of cultural expressions.

African diaspora in Europe, Canada, and beyond – Black culture in the UK, France, and other countries mixes African heritage with local influences, often linked to immigrant communities.

African continent – While African cultures are distinct by region, they have influenced diaspora cultures globally, through music, religion (like Vodou, Santería), storytelling, fashion, and more.

So, “Black culture” is more of a global, interconnected phenomenon than something limited to African Americans. African American culture is a particularly visible and influential subset, but it’s part of a much wider mosaic.

If you want, I can map out how African American culture intersects with other Black cultures globally—it’s really interesting to see the cross-influences. Do you want me to do that?


black being two things, identity/skin colour and culture

there is also third dimension of country of origin, wher eculture gets iffy

e.g. a lot of black people across the world e.g. carribens, african americans and british africans have some shared values e.g. food and music/dance

then other culture that stemmed out of dealing with the fact that other people treat us differently because of our skin colour

issues come from when you have one aspect of being black without respecting the other

e.g. white people taking black culture or black people not acknowledging black culture


african americans view themselves as disavantaged, but africans dont really beause they dont have the comparison in front of them

people feel sad to not know their distant heritage too


looking forward:
- a lot of black identity/culture comes from distant ptast of afrian identity, even if some people cant remember it due to time

- should raise ecnomoic and poltical power of africa and black people

- should be proud of the origin of black culture from africa and how it is shared among black people, similar to how different countries share their cultures, we should not close off these black communities from people who don't have black skin, because 1. it's fun to share our culture, and other people like it 

(idea that afrobeats wasn't fun before)
, but more importantly because we can use it to educate them on our complex history, and how a lot of black culture existed to give black people a voice against opression, but also to share african culture which is also cool


i existed in a bubble a bit before where i didnt see the effects of racial discrimination much

e.g. i didnt have to have a job that much

and also at school it was mostly okay

hearing about the person who told issa his story in china was eye opening


although i did experience the effects of xenophobidia

one cannot lead without leading themselves first e.g. to run a company you should be a able to run one by yourself
(altho maybe that example is slightly different)

to teach people sports you have to be capable yourself

(altho maybe coaching is slightlyyy different)

I have to let the tap off on a lot of the stuff I've already mostly written. Otherwise it will say stuf in draft purgatory


read the best books first -> then don't write the best books

In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.
