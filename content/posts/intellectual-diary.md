# Stuff I've seen



20/6/2025 - A bunch of stuff by Ben Francis. Seems like a great guy. (Met him on the train on Wednesday)

24/6/2025 - [A poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/t37ocb/letting_the_cat_out_of_the_bag_from_united_auto/)

[A cool visualisation](https://engaging-data.com/how-rich-is-elon-musk/)

[Black researchers in the UK](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04386-w/index.html#:~:text=Starting%20out,more%20diverse%20range%20of%20students.)

(Winter 2024 books I read)
Sticky book...

#### 28/6/25

- Read a lot of essays from tech people on career advice. It's satisfying to read something and not understand completely in the moment for it to make sense later (also probably cause im more aligned to tech now)
- For some reason I always come back to young money every year or so

- [How to work hard](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)
- [Altman. How to be successful ](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

Meeting Ben Francis really shone a light on how he understands high performers like CEOs work, himself included. Just on a different level to most people.




- Watched some Ali Abdaal. Seeing his general productivity content is sometimes too broad reminds me of the power of niche,

How AI will change the world for high achievers
basically a limited amount was on the internet before (up to approx. an undergraduate education)
- makes accessing that way faster 
- also successful people used to blog, now more of them will be on social media -> we get a better understanding of them.
- before people had to write books abount them -> filtered opinion
[an article on this](https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/tech-entrepreneurship-and-the-disruption-of-ambition-4e6854121992)

Finding out what successful people are like
can ask POVs of successful people
NB what successful people appear like is not what they are necessariy. look at opinions from other high achieving people, survey works or ask them yourself
being around them will also make other things salient that you don't realise e.g. me being around olympians and hard work being more salient

why do I drink? maybe I should quit

[text](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/teaching-problem-solving-undergraduate-mathematics.pdf)

[Terrance Tao on maths](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)
- the three stages are similar for most technical subjects

David Dobbs
[How to be genius](https://talentdevelop.com/articles/HTBAG.html)
Decade of dedication

"This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach."
In my experience of sports, most technical ones require at least around 4-7 years to be pretty good at a university level

Could talk about my experience of talent

[TT on parenting for gifted children](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/advice-on-gifted-education/)
- Dublin Centre for Talented Youth

I suspect most Oxford students must probably all be slightly neurodierse in some way

[Lemonade stand dragons den simulation for complex decision making](https://youtu.be/yGvXwTu3n4U?si=k5eL7Bwxk6RlITfn&t=1748)

Seems like an effective exercise to generate utility similar to this Ben Kuhn article about staring into the [abyss](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)

[Another article by BK on complex decision making](https://www.benkuhn.net/conviction/#:~:text=Since%20I%20had%20plenty%20of%20free%20time%2C%20I%20spent%20it%20thinking%20through%20my%20plans%20from%20first%20principles.)



- we have rigorous athlete training programs, what are our intellectual ones? Harder becuase less of a reward function like 100 metre times

- All Debates Are Bravery Debates -> advice depends on not just the individual, but the group

- How I want to reverse the stereotype fo Oxford
 "The stereotype of, e.g., MIT alums that end up spending the rest of their life only hanging out with other MIT students, does happen to some people. It’s a reasonable personal choice (normal people can be annoying!), but if you’re optimizing for impact on the rest of the world, it will be a handicap."

- what does college actually represent (to employers)? reverse engineering job applications
Basically that you worked hard at something, and the you do an additional skills based assessment on top of that


- Anthpo was kids with crocs and he was really happy he got 10k followers (you don't need to have the biggest goal to start off with)

- "I actually think college is a pretty garbage place to explore your interests because you find out what it’s like to take classes about your interests, but that’s not actually what your interests are going to look like for the rest of your life. " BK

I think the scott galloway thing said happiness is 20% genetic

There must be a list of biases from popular media
- 
Biases from popular media

- that you have a calling
- that you [either have talent or hard work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n)
-that geniuses exist

"The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard."


Before I used to chase places I wouldn't be bored/would challenge me, to be surrounded by the smartest people
now that metric doesnt exist as easily anymore
maybe YC for example could be a place
Now I think I have a slightly more complex metric. e.g. 


Be aware of our assumptions and what media sells you e.g. [Steve Jobs didn't do it all himself](https://guzey.com/autistic-leaders/)
(Business skills are hard to gain)

[financial distance and tax evasion](https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/01/power-buys-you-distance-from-the-crime/)

I should improve my PM skills e.g. make success inevitable https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/#make-success-inevitable


[i could move to Africa...emerging markets...](https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/)


Why is there no canon for life's most important questions?

If we go to study economics, we quickly become familiar with The Wealth of Nations and Keyne's General Theory. If we become interested in moral philosophy, we swiftly encounter Reasons and Persons and A Theory of Justice. But for many of life's most important questions, we won't find any similar canon. That is, there are no similarly definitive books about how to navigate your education, how to select a career, how to choose a partner, how to be a good friend, or how to raise your children well. That's not to say that there aren't lots of books on these questions. There are, of course. But there are none that are so good, or important, that you might assume that others interested in the questions will be familiar with their ideas. Is it not possible for there to be "great" books about these questions? Or have they just not been written yet?


Everybody writes for at least version of themselves. You can't write to an audience you don't relate with at all (as far as I know).

Read the best book first

hackathons must be going crazy rn with AI??

i realised this a bit ago) not every business needs to be a vc business

28/6/2025

You get paid for top down/open ended skills. E.g. strategy consulting, management

complex problem solving

or bottom up skill, usually hard skills more or less with training e.g. engineering, coding


the real opportunity is when you can combine the two. That's basically an entrepreneur

i thought i need to make the perfect idea, spend a lot of time making it good. launch it and people would love it and then live happy ever after. It doesn't work like that!
and it takes time to break our misconceptions

Most metrics of things that actually matter suck

a degree in product management would be so versatile in today's society

companies could iterally post curriculums they want you to learn

it's easiest to sell the product when you truly believe in it (including yourself)


"We live in a time where it's easier to reach the entire world than it is to reach your neighborhood." this hit hard...

[interesting channel-real people](https://www.youtube.com/@RealPeopleTV/videos)
On April 18, 1979 at 8pm a new kind of television series was born. The format was so different no one had a way to describe it yet. The New York Times said it blurred the lines between news and entertainment. Producer George Schlatter agreed and called it “theater of reality.” In the days before the internet and YouTube, everyday people were given a spotlight for the first time. The show brought people around the country closer as it celebrated accomplishments big and small, the quirky, the challenged, and in some of its best moments, paid tribute to real life heroes in the military. Defying description, Real People went on to become a huge hit for NBC during its five years, giving rise to many imitators and eventually creating the genre, reality television.

"Advice number 2 reminds me of this silly tiny change that made my life so much better! All I did was spend about $3 on a charger cable that's way too short to reach my bed from the outlet and I gave my long cable away. At nights, I had no choice but to leave my phone away from me when the battery died and I could no longer watch tiktok for hours. Self control and discipline is definitely overrated in the sense of what we hear on social media... Your own brain would never stop you from your addiction on its own.
