# Stuff I've seen



20/6/2025 - A bunch of stuff by Ben Francis. Seems like a great guy. (Met him on the train on Wednesday)

24/6/2025 - [A poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/t37ocb/letting_the_cat_out_of_the_bag_from_united_auto/)

[A cool visualisation](https://engaging-data.com/how-rich-is-elon-musk/)

[Black researchers in the UK](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04386-w/index.html#:~:text=Starting%20out,more%20diverse%20range%20of%20students.)

(Winter 2024 books I read)
Sticky book...

#### 28/6/25

- Read a lot of essays from tech people on career advice. It's satisfying to read something and not understand completely in the moment for it to make sense later (also probably cause im more aligned to tech now)
- For some reason I always come back to young money every year or so

- [How to work hard](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)
- [Altman. How to be successful ](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

Meeting Ben Francis really shone a light on how he understands high performers like CEOs work, himself included. Just on a different level to most people.




- Watched some Ali Abdaal. Seeing his general productivity content is sometimes too broad reminds me of the power of niche,

How AI will change the world for high achievers
basically a limited amount was on the internet before (up to approx. an undergraduate education)
- makes accessing that way faster 
- also successful people used to blog, now more of them will be on social media -> we get a better understanding of them.
- before people had to write books abount them -> filtered opinion
[an article on this](https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/tech-entrepreneurship-and-the-disruption-of-ambition-4e6854121992)

Finding out what successful people are like
can ask POVs of successful people
NB what successful people appear like is not what they are necessariy. look at opinions from other high achieving people, survey works or ask them yourself
being around them will also make other things salient that you don't realise e.g. me being around olympians and hard work being more salient

why do I drink? maybe I should quit

[text](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/teaching-problem-solving-undergraduate-mathematics.pdf)

[Terrance Tao on maths](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)
- the three stages are similar for most technical subjects

David Dobbs
[How to be genius](https://talentdevelop.com/articles/HTBAG.html)
Decade of dedication

"This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach."
In my experience of sports, most technical ones require at least around 4-7 years to be pretty good at a university level

Could talk about my experience of talent

[TT on parenting for gifted children](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/advice-on-gifted-education/)
- Dublin Centre for Talented Youth

I suspect most Oxford students must probably all be slightly neurodierse in some way

[Lemonade stand dragons den simulation for complex decision making](https://youtu.be/yGvXwTu3n4U?si=k5eL7Bwxk6RlITfn&t=1748)

Seems like an effective exercise to generate utility similar to this Ben Kuhn article about staring into the [abyss](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)

[Another article by BK on complex decision making](https://www.benkuhn.net/conviction/#:~:text=Since%20I%20had%20plenty%20of%20free%20time%2C%20I%20spent%20it%20thinking%20through%20my%20plans%20from%20first%20principles.)



- we have rigorous athlete training programs, what are our intellectual ones? Harder becuase less of a reward function like 100 metre times

- All Debates Are Bravery Debates -> advice depends on not just the individual, but the group

- How I want to reverse the stereotype fo Oxford
 "The stereotype of, e.g., MIT alums that end up spending the rest of their life only hanging out with other MIT students, does happen to some people. It’s a reasonable personal choice (normal people can be annoying!), but if you’re optimizing for impact on the rest of the world, it will be a handicap."

- what does college actually represent (to employers)? reverse engineering job applications
Basically that you worked hard at something, and the you do an additional skills based assessment on top of that


- Anthpo was kids with crocs and he was really happy he got 10k followers (you don't need to have the biggest goal to start off with)

- "I actually think college is a pretty garbage place to explore your interests because you find out what it’s like to take classes about your interests, but that’s not actually what your interests are going to look like for the rest of your life. " BK

I think the scott galloway thing said happiness is 20% genetic

There must be a list of biases from popular media
- 
Biases from popular media

- that you have a calling
- that you [either have talent or hard work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n)
-that geniuses exist

"The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard."


Before I used to chase places I wouldn't be bored/would challenge me, to be surrounded by the smartest people
now that metric doesnt exist as easily anymore
maybe YC for example could be a place
Now I think I have a slightly more complex metric. e.g. 


Be aware of our assumptions and what media sells you e.g. [Steve Jobs didn't do it all himself](https://guzey.com/autistic-leaders/)
(Business skills are hard to gain)

[financial distance and tax evasion](https://acesounderglass.com/2019/08/01/power-buys-you-distance-from-the-crime/)

I should improve my PM skills e.g. make success inevitable https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/#make-success-inevitable


[i could move to Africa...emerging markets...](https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/)


Why is there no canon for life's most important questions?

If we go to study economics, we quickly become familiar with The Wealth of Nations and Keyne's General Theory. If we become interested in moral philosophy, we swiftly encounter Reasons and Persons and A Theory of Justice. But for many of life's most important questions, we won't find any similar canon. That is, there are no similarly definitive books about how to navigate your education, how to select a career, how to choose a partner, how to be a good friend, or how to raise your children well. That's not to say that there aren't lots of books on these questions. There are, of course. But there are none that are so good, or important, that you might assume that others interested in the questions will be familiar with their ideas. Is it not possible for there to be "great" books about these questions? Or have they just not been written yet?


Everybody writes for at least version of themselves. You can't write to an audience you don't relate with at all (as far as I know).

Read the best book first

hackathons must be going crazy rn with AI??

i realised this a bit ago) not every business needs to be a vc business

28/6/2025

You get paid for top down/open ended skills. E.g. strategy consulting, management

complex problem solving

or bottom up skill, usually hard skills more or less with training e.g. engineering, coding


the real opportunity is when you can combine the two. That's basically an entrepreneur

i thought i need to make the perfect idea, spend a lot of time making it good. launch it and people would love it and then live happy ever after. It doesn't work like that!
and it takes time to break our misconceptions

Most metrics of things that actually matter suck

a degree in product management would be so versatile in today's society

companies could iterally post curriculums they want you to learn

it's easiest to sell the product when you truly believe in it (including yourself)

[interesting channel-real people](https://www.youtube.com/@RealPeopleTV/videos)
On April 18, 1979 at 8pm a new kind of television series was born. The format was so different no one had a way to describe it yet. The New York Times said it blurred the lines between news and entertainment. Producer George Schlatter agreed and called it “theater of reality.” In the days before the internet and YouTube, everyday people were given a spotlight for the first time. The show brought people around the country closer as it celebrated accomplishments big and small, the quirky, the challenged, and in some of its best moments, paid tribute to real life heroes in the military. Defying description, Real People went on to become a huge hit for NBC during its five years, giving rise to many imitators and eventually creating the genre, reality television.

"Advice number 2 reminds me of this silly tiny change that made my life so much better! All I did was spend about $3 on a charger cable that's way too short to reach my bed from the outlet and I gave my long cable away. At nights, I had no choice but to leave my phone away from me when the battery died and I could no longer watch tiktok for hours. Self control and discipline is definitely overrated in the sense of what we hear on social media... Your own brain would never stop you from your addiction on its own. You need to force it to find your addiction too inconvenient."

Been very interested in economics recently too. It's interesting because for example what people pay for stuff isn't necessarily its true value, so what affects this?

It's interesting because economics is about a lot more than just money, and some metrics like PPP try and represent this.

While we do focus on the increase in wealth in terms of money since that's the main thing we mweasure. Increases in stuff like livelihood and happiness can lead to longterm incresaes in wealth anyway, so for those money obsessed it still comes down to the same thing e.g. trying to increase productivity in the long run.

The “bitter lesson” in AI is that general methods that leverage increases in computational power eventually surpass methods that utilize human domain knowledge by a large margin. This is a valuable observation about methods, but it is often misinterpreted to encompass application development. In the context of AI-based product development, the bitter lesson has never been even close to true. Consider recommender systems on social media: They are powered by (increasingly general) machine learning models, but this has not obviated the need for manual coding of the business logic, the frontend, and other components which, together, can comprise on the order of a million lines of code.

need to include my chat with AI about implementing FPTP in normal elections (chatGPT or gemini probably)

selection pressure of an idea
- how impactful/entertaining it is (Psychological Attractiveness, Social Utility or Identity Signaling)
- how easy it is to replicate (how easy it it to understand and then communicate)
- Compatibility with Existing Beliefs/ how believeable it is

https://chatgpt.com/share/68725e15-e3c0-8003-b56d-5408bcde8bfc

Anthpo's structure of ideas

6 principles of influence/pyschology of consumption

social liking

how we consume things/are influenced. all of our feelings and emotion can be categorised into one of these six things
-scarcity (Michael reeves, aura)
-consistency (can still upload every year but be scarce)
-reciprocity
-consensus (if it has a million likes it's easier to watch)
-similarity (can't repeat the formula, have to innovate on it with context). have text on screen have your face in first frame. if you follow every thing in rulebook people won't care because it's already been done
-authority (effort can also help with this -because it shows it's worth listening to)

how e.g. career ideas spread? in america it's easier than in the UK
another example. fitness influencers. they typically have autheority and consistency. potentialy similarity and consensus too. the biggest ones do most of these

i wonder how this applies to those memories that you have of 10+ years ago which really impacted how you saw the world e.g. when talking with your parents
or your parents' memories of you when you were young and which memories/stories they choose to tell ig. what they think most describes/is relevant to you ig and how entertianing/fun the story is to tell

why flexing yourself improves your standing and also social inequality because you share your knowledge to increase the spread of information from elite sources and increase the culture of sharing your knowledge to level the playing field once everyone knows how to

or even like fitness influencers. need to give thiese marketing tools the most to people who are actually impactful. to help balance the inflationary view of marketing.

idea: marketing makes long term economics less efficient because a company can have more perceived value (especially to consumers, but also partially to businesses) because of marketing. 

imagine food was just sold in paper bags with standard names in the supermarket. you would just buy food based on its quality. 

Removing marketing from the equation isn't really feasible though, so we should try and do our best to democratise education around all companies/businesses/people.

another idea: do a study on how following instagram fitness influencers affects workout performance. maybe for two groups that have planned workouts, one with social media and one without 

north star effect tho

the idea is to understand how social media following affects motivation/knowledge with something measurable e.g. fitness gains

some hypotheses: doom scrolling fitness but not acc doing it doesn't help you. correlation bewteen watching fitness and doing it means people who watch the content are fitter. 

it's like the starved for information thing. like are you actually learning.

maybe do it with learning -> following a bunch of physics accounts (or could do another field), then somebody who watches a bunch of YT videos (e.g. 3blue1brown ) while both are doing a physics course or something.

trying to capture the videos that give you the sense that you feel like you're learning but you're actually not e.g. video essays. quite often it's a balance tho bewteen information and entertainment

a lot of these apply to EA like similarity/curse of knowledge. if you just go on the website it doesn't tell you in a simple concrete way relative to what you already do, what you should do to improve the world

e.g. they tell you what you should work on but that relies on having a specific mental model already (that most people don't have) to reach that conclusion. instead should market towards a different mental model.



the way you're able to synthesise this is repeated experiemtns through a lot of different enviornments (naturalistic) as well as specific testing methodoolgy.

also all likes and views are not the same. e.g. x likes on a personal vlog is very differnt to a random guy on tiktok flexing his jawline

creators in politics
that one cyprus guy
podcasts in the US 2024 election
trump is very good at going viral and stuff

social media and the spreading of ideas is becoming way more importnat
also companies are slowly figuing this out. e,g, crocs hiring anthpo, but not knowing if it's successful till the washington post writes about it

also one person/small group of people probably had a bigger influence than a lot of money paying one celebrity to wear it potentially

how does a brand show up to a party and not be a stranger. how does it show up and be cool with the group of friends, have good aura kind of

anthpo has a plan for failure too
following a trend not making one. idea in marketing

the framework for art and comedy. simalarity/commentary but slightly different
making people feel something with art.


viewing from a third party POV. leave it for two days and give it the fresh eye watch.

unit of conversation vs unit of entertainment

maybe make a cool carousel post too

anthpo doesn't really feel like he's speaking corporate speak on the podcast, feels authentic joking around and stuff
"love of the game" -> building on the current culture. an artist of social media combined with some pyschological principles

good conversationalist, passionate about people

it also shows that most cool things take time, with the amount of time he spends on editing

a thing reaches saturation when a company can train people to do it easily. the world is definitely not near that level with social media yet -> there's a lot fo opportunity, first to get good at experimenting and second at codifying knowledge

that's why staying on top of innovation is important. most people are not early adopters lol, they adopt it when it gets easy to use and is mainstream

that thing of breaking past yoru limits, japanese thing or something

how to measure your life
children learn when they're ready to learn. and they use their own generative models to figure out how their parents got to where they are. they instincetively probably want to emulate them in some way or use their expertise.

e.g. education is important can only be seen if parents got to their current point through education or are still studying
r.g. my dad trying to learn business(to an extent)
(altho being entrepreneurial and taking risks maybe doesn't work that well if the risks don't pay off-need to take measured risks)

or using phones etc.

kids essentially look at the actions of their parents and see what results it produces and backtrack to see how it should affect their policy/view on life

used to enjoy frameworks e.g. types of learners in school, work hard or they're smart or (in the middle). or they don't care/are not smart/are stupid. (or both smart and work hard?? tho i dont think this level of granularity matters)

i remember 3 types

something like tat

i used to be disappointed in the worl daround 14 when i saw so much of it can be described by simple patterns and frameworks. people make the same mistakes.but you can help improve those mistakes!! through education/information e.g. about frameworks of wisdom

so they can learn through experience more quickly and not make the same ones. and to avoid making the biggest mistakes maybe e.g. like smoking or addiction.

or even in relationshops. by helping people learn about themselves and to get rid of trauma or bad intuitions learnt in childhood (e.g. like anxious/avoidant vocab helps you learn about yourself)

esp when I was younger, tried to steer away from stuff that had too many details/where frameworks didn't work as well and tacit knowledge become moore important. e.g. game development in unity.
tried to maximise my framework learning i guess

He introduces what he calls “Truman’s Law” to explain this. According to a story, U.S. President Harry Truman once said that a “truly great president is right 51% of the time.” This might sound like a low bar, but it reveals a deeper truth: in complex, unpredictable systems—like war, leadership, or history—even a slight edge in good decisions over bad ones can make a leader (or a process) successful in the long run.

in Britain, in World War II, obviously there was serious food rationing of course. People’s health got better because of the massively improved equality of access to nutrition. These are just extraordinary facts to me, but I’m not sure what the conclusion is.

Need to have STAR in companies

As a mathematician working in decision making, I am happy that you make a video on such topics. 
I also appreciate that you mention some of these better alternative systems (see also "Majority jugement" from Balinski & Laraki).
I believe it would be great that you spend some time to explain one of these alternative system in detail, and show their strength.

Now, there is on crucial thing you did not adress in your video: ensuring people actually deviate from  the highly risky "first past the post"  system.
 If we keep presenting these only with example of presidential elections, it is likely that nobody will change our voting systems for a few more centuries. 
 But when you realize that the "first past the post" system is actually used everywhere, from family circle, friends,  associations, companies, etc, you can understant the massive risk it creates on a societal scale. The moment a CEO understands the risks it takes by using the "simplest" system in a company, he/she will try something else: and at this point almost ever other system is better. 
 Indeed, since "first past the post" does worse than just possibly electing bad propositoin: it actively favors the most cleaving proposition. Hence imagine the massive risk this creates when applying this in a governing board ! (and most companies use it without even being aware of the risk)
 
 Hence I  humbly suggest you make another video, with other examples of decision, focusing on the risk of "first past the post" system, and discussing one concrete alternative in detail.
The idea, I believe is to first convince companies, associations, and people to stop using this crazy system in their collective decisions and use an alternative one. The moment they try an alternative, they win.
I'll be happy to further dicuss such points.

bad ideas seem like good ideas
History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect it seems obvious they were going to make it big. For that reason one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to me when I first heard about it. A site for college students to waste time? It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.


to get into oxford it helps a lot to know someone who's been there as a mentor e.g. school coordinator for oxbridge in KES, tells you mentality, what you should be doing for PS, goals and baseline for grades, personal statement etc

that's probably a very important thing

also curious you're way more likely to become a professor if one of your parents were a professor

According to our special report on Gen Z workers, only 55% of Gen Z sees how their work contributes to larger goals—compared to the average of 70%—and only 69% see value in their work—compared to the average of 77%. There’s an opportunity for managers of Gen Z workers to more clearly communicate and manage the success of their youngest employees.

I also think managers of young teams should take a more substantial role in helping Gen Z manage their notifications and technology. To codify that culture, turning off notifications or setting the frequency should be part of the onboarding process. And as a manager yourself, be sure to practice what you preach so that everyone on your team can look to you as a positive example.

I always wanted to be a screenwriter but I realized how competitive it was. just getting your foot through the door is a slim-to-none chance. So I decided I wanted to write the stories I wanted to tell as books and self-publish them. I was 24 when I thought of that. After an hour, I decided not to. I told my dad “if I start now, I won’t even be good or known until I’m 35.” And he said the most profound thing I’ve ever heard. He said “yes but if you DONT start now, you’ll be 35 anyway, but you won’t be a writer.” Two years have passed and I have 3 books published on Amazon. I’m not well known and still not as good as I want to be, but I make sales, and that’s all I need to be inspired. What Joe said here is true: find something and work at it. Starting from scratch sucks, but not starting is instant failure.

Educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom found that one-on-one tutoring using mastery learning led to a two sigma(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?

In a related vein, this large-scale meta-analysis shows large (>0.5 Cohen's d) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."

 While taste is often focused on a single thing, it is often formed through the integration of diverse, and wide-ranging inputs.

It spoke well of Mike Li that he was able to sense the aura of formidability surrounding Jaynes.  It's a general rule, I've observed, that you can't discriminate between levels too far above your own. E.g., someone once earnestly told me that I was really bright, and "ought to go to college".  Maybe anything more than around one standard deviation above you starts to blur together, though that's just a cool-sounding wild guess.

[AI safety ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_iA7imAPs)
I think we are more or less just hardwired to be mildly optimistic and to act as if we can deal with everything. That's because generally that is the best way to act. There is no evolutionary advantage to being doomed and admitting it.

-> we evolved to have hope. and also want to be alive.

Agree. If you're doomed and recognize it, you die just as much as the guys who were doomed and didn't. But if you're not doomed and (wrongly) recognize it, you might die because you stop caring, and the ones who didn't do

Ezra Klein: The rationality community.

Tyler Cowen: Well, tell me a little more what you mean. You mean Eliezer Yudkowsky?

Ezra Klein: Yeah, I mean Less Wrong, Slate Star Codex. Julia Galef, Robin Hanson. Sometimes Bryan Caplan is grouped in here. The community of people who are frontloading ideas like signaling, cognitive biases, etc.

Tyler Cowen: Well, I enjoy all those sources, and I read them. That’s obviously a kind of endorsement. But I would approve of them much more if they called themselves the irrationality community. Because it is just another kind of religion. A different set of ethoses. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but the notion that this is, like, the true, objective vantage point I find highly objectionable. And that pops up in some of those people more than others. But I think it needs to be realized it’s an extremely culturally specific way of viewing the world, and that’s one of the main things travel can teach you.

This isn't at all to say that small-r rationalism isn't useful, but Rationality as an ~ideology, and the community itself, is less impressive than it seems to perceives itself to be (in Tyler's opinion, with which I strongly agree).


would like to read more about the philosophy of decision theory later

e.g. the difference between Causal Decision Theory  and Evidential Decision Theory


https://chatgpt.com/share/68786908-5754-8003-9ffe-0da1b44fe55b


The area you want to explore is generally called Philosophy of Decision Theory or more broadly, Philosophical Decision Theory. It intersects several fields:

Key fields and topics to look into:
Decision Theory (Philosophical and Formal)

This is the core field studying how agents should make choices under uncertainty.

It covers normative theories (like CDT, EDT, and others), as well as descriptive theories (how people actually decide).

Philosophy of Action

Explores what it means to act, how actions relate to intentions, reasons, and consequences.

Foundational for understanding decision-making as intentional choice.

Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge and Belief)

Since EDT, for example, involves conditioning on evidence, epistemology overlaps with decision theory regarding how beliefs and evidence affect rational choices.

Formal Epistemology

Uses mathematical tools (probability theory, logic) to study knowledge, belief, and rational decision-making.

This is where Bayesianism comes in as a foundational framework.

Game Theory

Though often a separate branch of economics and math, it overlaps with decision theory in analyzing strategic interactions and rational choice.

Philosophy of Probability

Understanding the foundations and interpretation of probability is crucial for grasping Bayesian reasoning underlying EDT and FDT.

Recommended starting points / texts:
"An Introduction to Decision Theory" by Martin Peterson — a clear philosophical introduction covering CDT, EDT, and other theories.

"Rational Choice and Decision Theory" by Steven J. Brams — accessible intro to formal decision and game theory.

"The Foundations of Statistics" by Leonard Savage — classic work on Bayesian decision theory.

"Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment" by Michael Bishop and J.D. Trout — for the intersection of epistemology and decision theory.

Articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

Decision Theory

Bayesian Epistemology

Rational Choice Theory

More advanced:
Work by philosophers like James Joyce, Brian Skyrms, Peter Walley, and Derek Parfit often discuss decision-theoretic puzzles and foundational questions.

For newer stuff including FDT and related ideas, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) and rationalist writings are useful supplements.

to learn about:

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem: No voting system can perfectly translate individual preferences into a collective decision without violating certain fairness criteria (like non-dictatorship, unanimity, independence of irrelevant alternatives).

intelligence is emergent -> conways game of life

the emergent phenomenum has consciousness, and it believes it is aware, which is cool

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fPvssZk3AoDzXwfwJ/universal-basic-income-and-poverty
^interesting view on pvoerty

maybe instead of measuring amount of good or energy produced, we could measure time needed to survive

e.g. how many hours do we need to work to have basic needs like food, water and shelter (and friends?)

instead of measuring wealth maybe that's what we should be measuring

which is the whole thing about maybe GDP isn't the best metric and other ways to measure the wellbeing of a nation (e.g. PPP)

LLM formal language

https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216

https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17216v1

can you train on formal language? i.e. create large scale training data that only contains formal language, and use comrpession/remove the examples that don't exist

but this might only work cus like logic only works for deduction

yeah so need somewhere between the vast induction of LLMs which is like mindless induction and you can generate stuff that conradicts and the formal language/deduction capabilities of formal languages where you can't express a wrong statement

language of induction?

the solution? maybe Bayesian reasoning again lol

You don't have to solve the majority of hard problems you encounter in either business, design, or programming. Almost all of them can be restated as an easy problem, if you dare question the assumptions, reweigh the trade-offs, and stop diving after sunk cost.
