### C++ (not sure abt it but useful to learn)
- maybe contribute to open source, or look at ML on the edge with like PyTorch lite




### Embodied stuff

- Find some ESP32 projects

or something in C++ (with real time control)
    - like PID balancing robot

Like wednesday waffle device, where its like video voicemail

Or ESP32 habit tracker?

LLM on raspberry Pi 5?


### The more entrepreneurshippy ones

Personal journal app, enabled by AI (with focus on UX)

Wednesday waffle

The patterned swimming caps (need to look from jan or feb)

Smart LLM for studying YT videos more effectively

look at DocGPT

### Other

The reforge or whatever data science experience for BCG X or lloyds

The AWS photo archiving app

The AWS SQL database for olympic track records (would be interesting to compare like 100m time to the fastest times achievable at all by a person)

#### Other other 

mario kart ghosts

use an ML model to judge e.g. if consultants or client facing workers are more attractive thatn other ones

### ML engineer

train my own transformer
Implement the LoRa paper

### Language model stuff 

Do PCA on different countries and see how they compare, can also do with race and with different languages

Use information theory for "funny moments" or to measure cadence of speak - if you speak with cadence it's more impactful

Or to try and predict pauses based on information from LLMs

a bit like the Simon DeDeo paper

#### other ish

- trying to see the difference between cheap talk and polymarket or kalshi bets

- maybe try use some populat API


#### web scraping

find the cheapest can of coke in the UK

# studying networks

- seeing how social networks compare to irl ones, e.g. self similar, power law ness
- seeing how social networks change over time e.g. twitter or youtube creators, maybe the power law is flattening since attention has reached its max so far but amount of creators are increasing, and also the intensification of communities

## game development

- make the top down stealth game i wanted

- make the avatar inspired fluid based game with cell based flow,

- or just try some sort of top down fluid flow (from the side with gravity)

- make a 2d fluid simulation (poisson solver)? i think codetrain has some examples of this



### Hasson lab

Do some work with foundation model, or information modelling


doing an analysis of company values over time

> Second, it’s not clear what values are meant to represent. In some cases, they’re presented as personality traits, as a kind of corporate Myers–Briggs. Lego is imaginative and creative; Twilio is curious; EY values “teaming.”6 In other cases, however, values are framed as binding contracts to which both the company and its employees are accountable. Snowflake’s values are vaguely threatening. Coinbase, famously, makes being mission first a condition of employment. Lockheed Martin’s core values—printed on an “Ethics Awareness Training” PDF and shared alongside something called the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct—are basically a DocuSign from a lawyer.” ~ benn.substack.com

doing something like crawling wikipedia- apparently the everything goes to philosophy thing is wrong

maybe make an algorithm that finds the shortest connection

## agent based modelling


## game theory stuff

play games against AI

design an app for twitch chat e.g. sugarscape
