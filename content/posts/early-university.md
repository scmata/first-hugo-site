## What I would focus on if I started university again?

-building soft skills
-building relationships
-building career capital
-learning how to learn, make mistakes, get a feel for your surroundings

-set goals

-gain experiences

-become an adult. physical and mental health. balance.

-fresh start

enjoying the present

the hardest path is not the most fruitful e.g. studying

the advice you listen to can take multiple times to sink in.
e.g. knowing what consulting is
how pivoting works in business
how to get ideas for a business
