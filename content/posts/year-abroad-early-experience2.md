# The lessons I learned about life going studying abroad in Princeton Univerity in the US from England

Studying abroad was an experience I was both prepared and unprepared for. I'm accustomed to changing country moving between Ireland and the UK at 10 years old (an experience which took me about 2 years to fully integrate), but living in the UK the last 10 years I've gotten a bit comfortable. Hence I felt like it was time for a change.



The importance of self/being able to move

Once you start moving, you keep moving. Some people grow up in the same time and don't dream about the world around. 20s are for having wings, 30s are for growing roots/

The importance of home

The importance of saying yes

Being yourself 

Friendships are important


Wow, what an experience. I feel grateful for the opppornity to step outside my comfort zone but boy was I out of my comfort zone.
