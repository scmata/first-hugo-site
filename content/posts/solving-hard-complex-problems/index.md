When I started as a student, I wanted to solve "hard technical problems". After all, it's what I was good at in school and what interested me. The process of learning new maths or physics models and playing with them in my head to understand their consequences excited me - often a 3blue1brown video and a concept I didn't understand were all I needed. However, once I started working I realised that most problems that warrant a solution are not technical. Furthermore, I saw how learning the shiny new tool that humanity just came up with, such as machine learning or AI will not save the world. Actually, a lot of key problems are solved with [boring technology](http://boringtechnology.club/), so that you can focus on the several other dimensions these problems have. This took me more than a year to fully understand after reading [Ben Kuhn's original article](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/), so by explaining my understanding of problems beyond simply the "hard and technical", hopefully you can understand this message too.

## The issue with solving problems after school: Not every problem has a solution

For most of your education, most of the hard problems you've solved have a solution or even a score. This makes sense because the scores from tests are used as a measure of your ability compared to other people. Even the hardest problems you might have in school, such as maths competitions and science olympiads have clear solutions. Even the projects I had in Oxford had a rubric, like 15% of the grade for presentation, 15% for introduction and conclusion and 70% for engineering content.[^a]

[^a]: If you're curious. The full breakdown of my third year project in Oxford (/100) was:
    - Teamwork (/10)
    - Project Logbook (/10)
    - Oral presentation (/20)
        - Logical flow of explanation, clarity of presentation, quality of visual aids (8,8,4 respectively)
    - Written report (/60)
        - Presentation of report (/10)
        - Engineering content (/40)
        - Introduction and Conclusions (/10)

The issue is that real world problems are nothing like this. Even defining your problem can be a struggle. Defining how to measure the quality of your solution is another struggle. In fact, during my senior thesis I spent more than two weeks figuring out the best way of measuring the quality of an AI generated sentence for predicting natural conversation. This is common theme that when solving an interesting problem with a technical solution we have to provide a proxy problem instead. For example, language models are typically trained to predict the next word in a sentence, rather than generating language in a broad sense.


## The issues with technical problems

#### Human problems matter to people, not technical ones

All the problems that matter to people are human problems, we rarely care if the solution is technical or not. This might appear to conflict with what you think is an intellectually interesting problem. This conflict is more common the closer you get to pure maths or abstract theory too, where applications become less clear. Additionally, your incentives might include trying to find completely novel problems or unexplored territory, believing this is how you make your mark.  

However, instead of solving a problem somebody has never thought of before, if you solve a problem everyone has thought about before you will achieve more impact.[^c] The biggest human problems are universal and everlasting. Furthermore, the more universal the problem, the more impactful the solution. At an extreme, consider the problem "what is the meaning of life?", religion often provides an answer and it has given many people value.[^e] 

It pays to have an interest in understanding what problems people actually face. One framework to get you started is [health, wealth and relationships](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2022/06/05/100-million-hormozi.html). I encourage you to think of your own too. You will start seeing problems everywhere-from "how do we hire the best person?" to "how do I have a good holiday" and "how do I find a romantic partner?". Many successful companies are built on providing better solutions to these eternal challenges in our ever-changing world.[^d] 


[^e]: A lot of useful problems in our lives don’t have clear solutions. They potentially never will. These problems that people can spend their whole lives solving are a good example of complex, useful problems. For example:
    - How to be a good parent?
    - How do we teach people most effectively?
    - How do I choose my career?
    - How do we hire the best person?
    - How do I find somewhere to live?
    - How do I choose a romantic partner? and more...


[^c]: My internal metric for a good problem to solve is one that at least person would physically thank me for solving. While maybe not everyone will have the same problems, everyone within the same circumstances will deeply relate to it. When you pay attention, there are many problems and systems we face daily that could be improved. Many problems pass by unnoticed; others are invisible to us until we make the effort to understand different people’s needs and perspectives.

[^d]: Examples: 
    - Uber: I want transportation but more convenient. 
    - Stripe: I want to pay for things more easily. 
    - Notion: I want to have more free time.
    - Facebook/instagram: I want social connection with people I can't see physically.


#### Non-technical skills provide leverage for big problems 

Say that you find a problem you want to work on. A one person team can only scale so far because you are limited by the amount of hours you have in a day. Hence, to scale impact you need leverage in the form of people.[^f] This involves hiring effectively, delegating responsibility and coordinating collective effort. This is true for any big problem in any industry.

If you're starting a company, you must assemble a strong team around a clear mission, develop a business model that can sustain growth, secure funding through revenue or investment, and build an organization designed to scale. If you want to become a professor, you must rally teams around research questions, secure funding through grant proposals and coordinate complex projects with multiple contributors. In all paths, leadership, management, and strategic thinking are key.

No great human problem was ever solved individually.

[^f]: “leverage” means the ability to multiply your impact beyond what you can achieve alone. In general, people-leverage trumps skills-leverage.

## How to start solving real problems: You can make a big impact with boring technology

Given all this information about the problems that affect people how do we go about actually solving these problems? 

First, use the best tool for the job instead of the most shiny one. This often means embracing [boring technology](https://boringtechnology.club/) - reliable, well-understood tools that will free up your energy for solving the problems that are most useful to solve - technical and otherwise. [Technology alone is not a silver bullet](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/an-autobiographical-synopsis-of-kentaro-toyamas-geek-heresy-3b3251c23cd1): one app won't solve healthcare or poverty. Real solutions require understanding systems, changing behaviors and working within constraints rather than around them.

For most hardworking and intelligent people, this approach will be very difficult. I've prided myself on my ability to solve any problem with enough time and effort – but this is not the way to think. You need to choose your battles.

Next, to get started and improve on solving real problems, you should learn [how to work hard](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) and how to develop [agency and taste](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/#i-agency). I think one of the most important things is to [take the initiative](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/take-the-initiative/) and define the problem for yourself and try it solve it your way. Once you start, make sure to [keep moving](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/) and [think real hard](https://www.benkuhn.net/thinkrealhard/) to solve the sub problems you encounter.



#### Solving real problems doesn't require the most modern technology

The amazing thing about the present is that technology allows us to innovate with relatively little upfront investment because we need minimal hardware compared to previous generations.

Consider what's possible: 55 years ago, Douglas Engelbart delivered the [Mother of All Demos](https://adamdrake.com/novel-results-considered-harmful.html) in 1968, introducing the world to revolutionary concepts that still define computing today:
- Video conferencing (connecting people across distances)
- The computer mouse (intuitive computer navigation)
- Word Processing (more efficient writing)

We live in a fast paced world, so it can be tempting to want a solution as quick as possible. Remember there are no shortcuts: find a real problem and try your best to solve it. When you are in doubt, think about Douglas Engelbart and his team and imagine what you can do with a few dedicated people, some capital, and focused time investment.

<!--maybe add note about executive aiming for 1-2 year goals to show their impact -->

## Summary

Instead of solving hard, technical problems, focus on solving human problems that people actually face in their daily lives. By using boring technolgy you can create big impact by giving yourself the resources to solve the problems that really matter, which are usually just as complicated and hard.

### Additional: Strategising around complex problem solving

Learning how to manage complex problems within a scope is an incredibly valuable skill that could fill books. In business, this type of problem solving often appears as "strategy", and strategy consulting essentially provides frameworks for tackling fundamental questions such as: "How do I make my business more profitable?" or "How do I make my business more resilient?"

The key insight for technical people is that the solution space for complex problems is enormous. Using a purely rationalist, bottom-up approach to analyze every possibility is not just impractical—it's impossible. Instead, you need a combination of top-down vision and bottom-up execution. Figuring out ways to navigate such a [high dimensional space](https://lethain.com/multi-dimensional-tradeoffs/) can be a fun challenge. Here are two thoughts to help:

#### Complex Problems Can't Be Solved, Only Navigated
Arthur Brooks said that complex problems [cannot be solved, only experienced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY1gwywkmvc). His analogy is a football game: you might have a set play for the first 10-20 seconds, but after that, with so many actors and possibilities in motion, you can't rely on deliberate analysis (System 1 thinking). You must shift to intuitive, adaptive responses (System 2 thinking).

This mirrors how successful leaders approach business strategy. They start with a clear initial plan but remain ready to adapt as circumstances evolve. The goal isn't to predict every scenario but to build the capability to respond effectively to whatever emerges using your wisdom and experience.

#### Truman's Law: Marginal choices compounds

Given the enormous possibility space in complex problem solving, historian Ian Morris introduced Truman's Law. When asked what makes a great president, Truman reportedly replied: "The truly great president is one who is right 51% of the time."

This highlights a deep insight about complex problem solving: Having a slight edge in good decisions over time can compound in complex, unpredictable systems.

He introduces what he calls “Truman’s Law” to explain this. According to a story, U.S. President Harry Truman once said that a “truly great president is right 51% of the time.” This might sound like a low bar, but it reveals a deeper truth: in complex, unpredictable systems—like war, leadership, or history—even a slight edge in good decisions over bad ones can make a leader (or a process) successful in the long run. -->


<!-- Ian Morris: Thinking about these processes, it occurred to me that one of the reasons it can be difficult to kind of get your head around these processes is that this is a long-term, large-scale kind of operation. So in a cycle of productive war, you’ll get plenty of wars that don’t conform to that generalisation. I took to thinking about what I call “Truman’s Law.” There is this story that Harry Truman, when he’s president of the US he gets asked by this journalist, “Tell me, President Truman, what is your definition of the truly great president?” And Truman thinks about this one moment, and he says, “The truly great president, young man, is one who is right 51% of the time,” which I think is actually quite a wise insight. But that is how these patterns work.-->

you want to be different, however the best way is to solve the problems everyone has thought about before. ( i used to chase new problems)

Intially, as you figure this out this will probably conflict with your measure for an "interesting" problem. 

grants are meant to focus problems on stuff that acutally matters


The other issue with solving IHTPs is that most of the most interesting problems involve non-technical components. I think the realm of technical and non-technical problems is starting to converge to an extent, as we learn to use computer to apply theories in fields such as computational neuroscience or computational social science. 



 First of all, generally anything you develop will be used by a human at some point (unless you work in pure math). Solving human problems are definitely not technical in nature. Learning how to trnstion them is

If you are a typical STEM graduate or student, you will felt the urge to solve "interesting hard technical problems". However, this thinking often limits you to a certain scope of problems. You will want to apply the new techniques you learnt in class and improve on the state of the art. The thing is, in the real world this often isn't a good solution. The added effort of new technology can distract you from other business problems like finding product market fit for example. This is something that has become more and more apparent to me as I've [read and reread Ben Kuhn's article on this issue](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/).



I could spend hours pouring over a 3blue1brown video with pages of matrix calculations in front of me, while figuring out the machinery of the new tools I was learning.








This approach will be psychologically challenging for most intelligent, hardworking people. For example, I've prided myself on the ability to tackle any problem with enough effort. To answer this I would say: "choose your battles" and "there are no silver bullets". When you realise technology is not a silver bullet for all your problems, Thinking like this you will pay attention to work

With more experience, you will be able to better understand which work actually moves the needle, instead of taking up your time.
