My first "blog" post.

<!--more-->

## The first post

In the beginning there was nothing. And then there was ***this post***, the first addition to this website.

Hopefully more will follow!

For now, here's an interesting video I saw recently:
{{< youtube id="jyQwgBAaBag" title="Travelling downwind faster than the wind" >}}

In short, it's about a vehicle that can travel downwind (i.e. in the same direction of the wind) faster than the windspeed. Confused? So was I.

The project is called DDWFTTW (Directly Down Wind Faster Than The Wind). See more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oJpnSJyV8). Credit goes to Rick Cavallaro & co.

I'll might try explain DDWFTTW in my own words a bit later. For now...here's some explanations I intend to look more closely at later:

1.[Mark Chu-Carrol's explanation](http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2008/12/07/the-real-bozo-attempts-to-atone-why-the-ddwftw-car-works/)

2.[Analysis of Down-Wind Propeller Vehicle
      Md. Sadak Ali Khan, Syed Ali Sufiyan, Jibu Thomas George, Md. Nizamuddin Ahmed (April 2013)](http://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-0413.php?rp=P161106)

An interesting thing about this invention is the number of people calling the designers idiots as they assume DDWFTTW obviously can't work - except it does. The critics even included science professors supposedly, which goes to show it's very easy to let your ego jump to conclusions. [Here's an emphatic example.](http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2008/12/03/wind-powered-perpetual-motion/)

That's all I've got to say for now. See you later!
