# are people actually getting more athletic?


certain athletic improvement e.g. track technology from ash tracks, starting blocks, spikes


I think the stuff you're doing with Lodestar is very cool and I imagine there's some interesting problems to solve esp since space requires such high reliability and precision

I am looking to start around July-September though, so I don't know if that would work with your hiring timelines?

On another note, 


factors that lead to 


training

genetic diversity + number of people competing from each country (and not prioritising other sports)

being able to perform/mental/preparation/coaching

human capital (height, % of fast twitch fibres)

on day effects/more temporary effects: tailwind, altitude

the writing workshop thing

male/female

technological improvements (spikes, shoes, launch platform/stands)



theoretical maximums of 9:45 for 100m and 1:57 for 

marathon

- running economy, VO2 max, 



why female records so much less consistent
