## why we have goals but aren't happy when we achieve them

# mastery and other people

Something I've been thinking about recently is mastery. And not the mastery where you can put 100 hours into a skill and people tell you "oh you're so talented" but true mastery, the one that only other practioners can understand.

# Having goals
This is an age old lesson, it is more important to focus on the process instead of the goal. But the process of life is not just about hedonistic pleasure: in Aesop's fable the grasshopper's solution to life is clearly not better than the ants's.

basically could turn it into a modern tortoise and the hare. The hare thinks life is about status and achieving big things, the tortoise doesn't focus on goals and just the experience of living life. The tortoise ends up happy by the hare is still questioning what should make him happy

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Humans generally want an explanation for everything. The most common word from a 2 year old is "why...", and this extends to unanswerable questions like the meaning of life which incite our curiosity. As some sort of answer we often create some sort of inherent meaning, because living with no answer would be much harder.

For ambitious people we dream. Chasing dreams like we chase God. We measure our life by that goal. Either two things happen, we achieve that goal and we realise that was not what gave our life meaning - or we don't.



David Foster Wallace - "The ultimate way you and I get lucky is if we have some success early on, and find out that it doesn’t mean anything."

Joseph Agassi - "My advice to you: try hard not to work. You’ll find out, and people will find that parasitic, but if you look around you will find that only the people who did what they wanted to do contributed to society significantly."





Not sure if this very nice, honest, insightful, great etc. piece needed an extra comment, but thought it cannot hurt to just insert this quote from Leonard Woolf (Virginia's husband): "I see clearly that I have achieved practically nothing. The world today and the history of the human anthill during the last fifty-seven years would be exactly the same as it is if I had played ping pong instead of sitting on committees and writing books and memoranda."

And one from Joseph Agassi (one of Popper's pupils): "My advice to you: try hard not to work. You’ll find out, and people will find that parasitic, but if you look around you will find that only the people who did what they wanted to do contributed to society significantly."





# fujino/kymoto

- at their split, kymoto has to stick true to her desires, she can't just follow someone elses
- fujino views art as a means to an end, only there to receive the bills and receieve praise
- fujino is head strong and achieves what she puts her mind to, kymoto despire quiet and anxious demenaor is self actualised because she doesnt need outside approval for her own self worth

also how hollywood actors do one big film, then one passion project

allegory to author's relationship with art



[look back - this scene is perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oiDY2kYDbg&t=6s)

you're so talented

tying identity to you doing manga, but when someone else is good she loses the identity, feels like an avergae kid

you want to stand out

competition, art (and science/knowledge discovery.)

Winning vs losing

You can't win at life


 "once you are ready to fail, you are ready to succeed"

what gives peoples goals and meaning

people have dreams, but once you achieve them are you living your dream life or are you going to have to create another dream to chase?


consistency

delusion, dreams

when do you stop? 


the reward for great work, is more great work

i didnt work all this time so i could retire

stay true to yourself

create without fear

you have something inside you

hell is other people

we need space to grow and be challenged. Before, we would hae to fly to the most talented people, but now the internet can give us a way to get in the room of other talented people a bit but it can't replace the feeling.

finding the right rooms are hard. where people want to continuousally grow and have the time.

working for other people/general audience or the others who get it.

e.g. in football playing to millions of screaming fans, but few people now about the vast hours of grinding to get it 


some people may have some dream, but the people i want to be around is not people who create for what it will give them but for the "love of the game"

zen philosophy, of living in the moment

the courage to be disliked.


we ignore the sparks inside of us because we're scared. we sometimes avoid human connection because we're scared



Man people kinda forget why “not trying” looks cool. It’s cool when someone is so good at something that they make it look effortless, but now things are just effortless

Focus on the process

If you have the right process, success is inevitable.

The courage to be disliked.

kenny dying words AoT, booze, women, god, family - everyone is drunk on something


theres a dude who made a tiktok talking about how he decided to make a video game, and it was his first time ever doing that, and it took him thousands of hours and it came out not that great and no one played it. the tiktok blew up and everyone started clowning on him for wasting all that time. i see that dude and i'm jealous of him. he has the drive to commit himself to learning a craft, even if he ends up failing on his first big project. i wish i was that kind of person. no one making fun of him has the guts to ever commit to something like that.

flow state

quote about success

everyone has a voice, you just need to find it. for some people that means thinking and experience more. for some people it means talking more.

remove your glass ceilings

the cycle between art and experience is like bewteen science with models and experiment. To create art you need experience, but you also create experience through art. Both rely on the other in some way.















splitting it between your task is to stick to your values, other people's task is to decide whether they like you or not.

YOu get messed up when you put other people's values on your back








Something I've been thinking about recently is the levels of skill needed for different activities.


10,000 hours for mastery.

The first 2 hours you can do hello world, or mary had a little lamb.

The first 40 hours you can do something and show it off yourself. Maybe rip tide or something. Or introduce yourself in a language and know a couple sentences.


Then there's a point.




Skils are not categorically separate. Lots of them have common foundations. e.g. muscality for dancing and playing an instrument.

Balance for basketball and taekwondo.
