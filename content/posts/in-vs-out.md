# The lost benefit of being from the status quo
# What you don't learn from being in the status quo


One thing that has become more salient to me recently is how few people know what it is like to not be in the status quo. They create stuff even like emo.

Some things you can't understand without living through it, you can't really imagine. Like imaginging being poor while being rich.

moving to a new country/ year abroad.

each culture has its own norms.
