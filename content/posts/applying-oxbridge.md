I was having a conversation earlier about applying to Oxbridge with a high school student. I realised that it's not obvious the best way to prepare your application and what mentality is needed. Here are some of my thoughts. If you are applying from a secondary school with a good oxbridge background they will likely have some version of this information, if you do not, hopefully this is most of the information you need.

Overall, the message I got when applying to Oxbridge is that they absolutely do not care about your extra curricular activities. This is extremely different from American universities (note in the UK we also apply to specific degrees at specific universities instead of any subject at one university). Oxbridge simply cares about 1. how good you are at your subject, 2. your potential to be good at your suject 3. how well you can succeed through their learning system (theoretical thinking+tutorials) 4. how well you can learn independently beyond the curriculum beyong the material dictated to you by your teacher in school. 

The Oxbridge assessment systems combine all the information they have on you and assesses you against these criteria. For example, Oxford engineering (data request thing). How much a specific part contributes towards your evaluation will depend on the subect, here I will talk mostly about physics and engineering because this is what I either experienced or looked most into.

In general there are several components when applying: GSCEs (normally relative to your year group in school), predicted A-level grades, personal statement, specific subject asssessment test (depends on subject) and interview. The university will take into account the first several items together, and then combine these components to decide who to invite to interview. If you are invited to interview they will use all the information they already have as well as the interview to decide who they finally give an offer to. The main variation between subject is the rigor/importance of different components, as well as maybe not having a subject assessment test.

If you come from a less privileged background, Oxford will make some level of allowances. They have the crankstart scholarship, and also have a foundation year for some courses. In the UK specific categories such as first generation university student, care, or low income background are targeted. 

The type of people to apply in my experience tended to be one of the smartest in their school. There's not much else I can say is concretely in common. I would also say that people who study here think differently, you can tell for example that socalising is different because people interact much differently. In general, they will actually process what you say to them and also generally have conversations about more "intellectual" topics. You can tell immediately walking into a room of Oxbridge people that they're wired differently, however I don't really have the tools to describe this further.
