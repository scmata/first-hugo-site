# Battling indefinite optimism in tech: A timeline of innovation since the 1600s

From Steam Engines to A/B Tests: The Shift in How We Innovate

Is innovation slowing down? Which fields is innovation happening in, and what can we do to improve it?

I studied engineering because I wanted to improve the world. However, if I wanted to get paid well I needed to get a job in finance or tech. If you were born 100 years ago, you saw your life transformed by innovations such as vaccines and electricity, whereas now it feels like breakthroughs in fundamental human needs is much harder. As such, most of my most intelligent friends are working in consulting or finance. What can we do about this?


The changing face of innovation

How to innovate when the low hanging fruit are gone

We are incentivised to rearrange 


Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange alreadyinvented ones. 

In theory, they should
champion products and processes that will be key to Unilever’s future success
five and ten years ahead. But the results of those efforts, only available many
years later, will garnish the record of whoever is in that specific assignment at
that time—not the person whose insight initiated it. If, instead, the HPLs focus
on delivering results they know can be seen and measured within twenty-four
months—even if that method isn’t the best approach—they know that the people
running the program will be able to assess their contribution to a completed
project. A


As long as they have something to show for their efforts, they know
they’ll have a shot at an even better next assignment. The system rewards
tomorrow’s senior executives for being decidedly focused on the short term—
inadvertently undermining the company’s goals.
Misaligned incentives are pervasive. For example, America is unable to
change its Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs—despite
the fact that everyone agrees that these programs are driving the country over a
precipitous cliff toward bankruptcy. Why? Members of the House of
Representatives stand for reelection every two years. These representatives,
rightly or wrongly, are convinced that if America is to be saved, they personally
need to be reelected in order to lead that effort



#### Indefinite optisim rules right now
- how we lost track of definite optimism

If we look at the timeline of innovation, yes. Between 1815 and 1970 there were several inventions made in the US and Europe (note before this more innovation in the East) that dramtically changed people's lives, including  including the invention of the computer, the discovery of germ theory, the steam engine and electricity. These led to several changes in how we live our lives and their quality, such as living longer, being able to travel more easily (flight) and spending less money on food and malnutrition a smaller risk.

By the 1970s, this type of innovation was mainly centered in the USA and Japan (the two biggest economies at the time) which capitalised on basic science from the scientific revolution appeared to slow down a lot. However, just after the USA put the first man on the moon a series of problems including energy crises, stagflation, and Vietnam disillusionment. Furthermore, Boomers (born ~1946–1964) came of age during a period of uninterrupted prosperity driven by postwar reconstruction, American global dominance, and cheap energy—so life improved steadily, seemingly without personal effort. This bred the belief that success would come automatically with a good résumé and a prestigious degree, not through bold planning or risk. When inequality rose in the 1980s–2000s, elite Boomers benefited the most, reinforcing their faith that the system still worked and didn’t need rethinking. This has led to a cultural shift away from true innovation. Japan also suffered 


## Innovation is ongoing, but people's lives aren't improving?

#### (Show the exponential growth curve)

Service based economies? It's harder cus they don't effect people's lives as directly, just improve effieincy

## Is innovation actually slowing down? A combination of two factors

## Is progress going to slow down? No - it will even increase

### Adding more context to innovation

First of all, it is useful to zoom out. There was a lot of innovation before 1815 with the industrial revolution or even before 1600 with the scientific revolution. (Add some info on the east here)

While it does appear there was a step change around 1815 because of cultural evolution and the printing press, innovation has been core to human advancement. However, not all technology will directly lead to human benefit e.g. the printing press. Making tools is essential to humanity - the ostrich analogy from founders podcast.

Explaining the massive growth is not easy, but appears to be tied to cultural evolution and printing press. Also
The scientific revolution in the 1600s led a transition from natural philosophy and knowledge from authority to empiritical observation, experimentaiton and mathemtical description including the scientific method. Furthermore, the spread of the printing press allowed knowledge to spread unlike ever before.

Since then we've seen a massive gain in innovation through engineering. Although while this did exist before (e.g. eygptians using pythagoreas to mark land, mathematics) and also stuff like the printing press, and fire, controlled use of fire, and impressive civil architecture, I think this shift in thinking laid a big foundation for the highly explosive growth from 1815 to 1971, including the invention of the computer, the discovery of germ theory, the steam engine and electricity.


## Incentivising innovation

If anything, innovation is speeding up instead of slowing down. (See addendum 2 too)

Globalisation vs Innovation 0:1 or 1:n
but I think this is just a cycle. Continual innovation e.g. the wheel and fire, and it's speeding up instead of slowing down. It's just that we're putting money into other things now because the path forward is less certain, because the basic science isn't as easy to use and other foundational science requires more work. 

More people, AI will improve research by improving economic efficinecy allowing more people to spend more time on research, as well as learn faster and engage collaboratively better.

However, this will need leaders.
Now, most innovation is focused on tech, which doesn't improve our lives in the same basic way as vaccines or the steam engine. For someone who is technologically capable what can we conclude?


### The low hanging fruit is gone - it is harder to actually improve people's lives

 Now it does feel a bit like the low hanging fruit is gone, Also marginal gains like malnutrition is really bad so easier to improve, but improving our diet isn't as bad. Or even being able to do the haber process, maybe it's harder now? Even athletics records are slowing down. Most technology development is in tech. Peter Thiel in his book Zero to One, makes the case that a lot of the developed world is in a state of indefinite optimism. This even comes into our language saying: 'the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing
nations implies that the “developed” world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer
nations just need to catch up.' Personally, I associate the word tech with computers a lot more now than general technology like engines and vacines.


#### What should we do about this?

Capable people need to be encouraged more to take bold risks. 


- If you want to be on the frontiers be in tech ( less likely to do it in engineering).
- Try and be aware of if you're actually producing innovation or globalisation. If you're providing profit by figuring out how to do A/B tests or making money in finance, maybe not the best idea.
- Investing in under explored basic science is probabably useful, just maybe not in your lifetime.
- If you have education in a more instutitonalised field - think about how you can use those skills in growing fields. Often they're very ripe for crossover e.g. physics to economics or statistics to other scientists


play the infinite game not the finite game?










Indefinite and defnite optimism


When I look around, a lot of innovation is focused on areas such as marketing and finance rather than breakthroughs in fundemental needs like healthcare, education or equitable economic opportunty.



However, after I graduated it felt like a lot of the low-hanging fruit was gone. Physics can now describe most of reality down to the point where we need 4km large machines to make experiments to try invalidate it, life expectancy has increased dramatically and steam engines aren't getting much more efficient. The two main things it feels like are left are "tech" - IT driven innovation and "deep tech" - attempts to pluck fruits from the tops of the trees of healthcare and engineering with features such as robotic surgery and quantum computing. 




A lot of recent innovation has been incremental improvements in entertainment, consumption, or finance rather than breakthroughs in fundamental needs like healthcare, education, or equitable economic opportunity.



Teh demand of sectors is reflected by the salaries


Technology is "the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry." However, the only new technology I've witnessed developed in my life time has been internet type things. I never had my man on the moon. In a way that transformed people's lives.

also the digital divide

What happened to technology? Why is all the innovation in tech right now

In the book Zero to One, Peter Thiel makes the claim that innovation boomed from 1815-1971 in the USA and since then it has slowed down, combined with a shift from definite optimism to indefinite optimism, and a shift of intelligent people from engineering and basic and applied science to fields like banking, private equity and management consulting, as well as finance in general. Is this true and what can we do about it? That is the focus of this article.


-main idea of article is that innovation is mostly in deep tech and IT, however the economy is still growing. IT is definitly trasnformative. We should be mindful of where we put our attention and not just become bankers, 


innovation isn't slowing down, but the culture around it is changing, and we have too much priority and recognition of non-useful careers


Thiel emphasizes that while indefinite optimism can lead to passive hope, definite optimism requires active engagement and planning. He believes that to achieve meaningful progress, individuals and societies must adopt a mindset of definite optimism—believing in a better future and taking deliberate actions to make it a reality

| 1914–1971     | 🚧 Low                    | 🚀 High                     | Nuclear, aerospace, computing, medicine                                |
| 1971–Now      | 🌍 High                   | 💻 Uneven (IT-led)          | Software, IT, biotech, but slower physical tech                        |



 In more depth: After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking
ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance eclipsed engineering as the way to
approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how
exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason
to design it concretely.
Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange alreadyinvented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing
companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And
private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra
efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations. It’s no surprise that these fields all
attract disproportionate numbers of high-achieving Ivy League optionality chasers; what could be a
more appropriate reward for two decades of résumé-building than a seemingly elite, process-oriented
career that promises to “keep options open”?

Is this true? yes to an extent. If we go through the innovations, we made several life changing discoveries in a range of fields such as germ theory, vaccines and antibiotics, the steam engine and electrciity production as well as flight, the telephone and nuclear technology. Now it does feel a bit like the low hanging fruit is gone, but I think this is just a cycle. Continual innovation e.g. the wheel and fire, and it's speeding up instead of slowing down. It's just that we're putting money into other things now because the path forward is less certain, because the basic science isn't as easy to use and other foundational science requires more work. Also marginal gains like malnutrition is really bad so easier to improve, but improving our diet isn't as bad. Or even being able to do the haber process, maybe it's harder now? Even athletics records are slowing down.



## Addendum: What drives innovation?

There are multiple ways of measuring human progress. Money, and lifespan for example. Ability for a human to harvest the most energy seems like one clear one supported by the author of Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari and Ian Morris. (Interestingly, they also have an argument that this shapes our culture too)

maybe information as a form of energy.

A fun book I recommend is Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery. It goes through the most important inventions and discoveries in human history, in chronological order. The first few entries include "stone tools," "fire," "religion" and "art"; the final pages include "Halley's comet" and "warm superconductivity."

An interesting fact about this book is that 553 out of its 654 pages take place after the year 1500 - even though it starts in the year 4 million BC. I predict other books of this type will show a similar pattern,14 and I believe there were, in fact, more scientific and technological advances in the last ~500 years than the previous several million.15

## Conclusions

Investing in basic science is probabably useful, just maybe not in your lifetime.

human culture gradually evolves towards whatever system of organisation allows a society to harvest the most energy, and we then conclude that system is the most virtuous one.

Explaining the massive growth is not easy, but appears to be tied to cultural evolution and printing press. Also

## Addendum 2: What caused the decrease in definite optimism (in the world and america)

America was the center of tech development after WW2, especially as basically the main country left more or less standing. Then it faced a series of challenges that have put us into this mood of indefinite optimism we have now.


That passage—mainly from Peter Thiel’s *Zero to One*—critiques what he sees as the dominance of **“indefinite optimism”** in American culture post-1980s. In plain terms, people believe the future will be better, but they don’t feel the need to plan or build it—just ride the wave. You’re asking, **what caused this shift?**

Let’s break down the main drivers:

---

### 🔄 1. **The Rise of Finance over Engineering (Post-1982)**

* The U.S. economy shifted from **making things** (engineering, manufacturing) to **moving money around** (Wall Street, consulting, law).
* 1982 marks the beginning of a long **bull market**. Stock markets soared, giving rise to careers focused on finance and asset management rather than invention or industry.
* If you can get rich by flipping companies or trading derivatives, why build a rocket?

---

### 🛠 2. **Loss of Technological Ambition**

* The 1960s–early 1970s were full of **definite optimism**: we landed on the Moon, built nuclear reactors, expanded highways, and dreamt of flying cars.
* But the **energy crises**, **stagflation**, and **Vietnam disillusionment** of the 1970s soured that belief in purposeful progress.
* In response, people became **skeptical of bold plans**—and instead, started just "optimizing" what already existed.

---

### 🍼 3. **The Baby Boomer Psyche**

* Boomers (born \~1946–1964) grew up during a time of **uninterrupted prosperity**, mostly because of postwar reconstruction, American hegemony, and cheap energy.
* Life kept getting better **by default**, not through personal effort.
* Many assumed this automatic progress would continue, and that **you didn’t need a plan**, just a good resume and a prestigious degree.
* When inequality rose in the 1980s–2000s, elite Boomers benefited most—**reinforcing their belief** that the system "works."

---

### 📈 4. **Careerism and Risk Aversion**

* High-achievers started optimizing for **optional paths** instead of bold bets: consulting, law, finance, tech product management.
* These careers are **“prestige safe zones”** that reward intelligence and polish, but not necessarily initiative or invention.
* Nobody wants to fail building something new when they could be rewarded more for tweaking Excel models.

---

### 🧠 5. **Cultural Shift Toward Process, Not Vision**

* Bureaucracy, credentials, and incremental gains became more valued than clear, directed purpose.
* Even tech companies started focusing on **user engagement metrics** over long-term innovation (think: infinite scroll vs. Moon landing).
* People were trained to play status games, not change the world.

---

### TL;DR:

> We stopped believing in bold visions because we could get rich without them.
> Finance replaced invention. Process replaced purpose.
> And elite success became more about staying on track than building the future.

---

If you want, we can dig into how this compares to other cultures (e.g., definite optimism in postwar Japan or China today) or what it would take to reverse this trend.


Absolutely — those three events in the 1970s **shattered American confidence** and helped kill the era of bold, definite planning. Here's a breakdown:

---

### ⚡ 1. **Energy Crises (1973 & 1979)**

**What happened:**

* In **1973**, OPEC (the oil cartel led by Arab nations) **cut oil exports** to the U.S. and other allies of Israel during the Yom Kippur War.
* Oil prices **quadrupled overnight**. Long gas lines, rationing, and massive inflation followed.
* Then in **1979**, after the **Iranian Revolution**, global oil supply collapsed again. Another spike.

**Why it mattered:**

* America's postwar boom was powered by **cheap energy**. Suddenly, that was gone.
* The crisis exposed America’s **dependency** on foreign oil and **fragility** of its economic growth.
* It shattered the idea that **material progress was inevitable**, and made large-scale industrial planning seem riskier and more fragile.

---

### 📉 2. **Stagflation (1970s)**

**What happened:**

* Normally, **inflation** (prices going up) and **unemployment** don’t rise together. But in the 1970s, **they did**.
* The U.S. had high inflation **and** high unemployment — a combo called **stagflation**.
* The Federal Reserve was powerless for years; policies either made inflation worse or deepened recessions.

**Why it mattered:**

* It **destroyed faith in the Keynesian consensus** that governments could always manage the economy.
* It suggested that **policymakers didn’t understand** how the system worked anymore.
* If you can’t even stabilize your economy, how can you plan for Mars colonies or nuclear utopias?

---

### 💣 3. **Vietnam Disillusionment (1955–1975)**

**What happened:**

* The U.S. fought a long, costly war in Vietnam to stop communism — and **lost**.
* **58,000+ Americans died**, and it ended in retreat and failure in 1975.
* The war was televised, brutal, and full of lies: the public saw **napalm, massacres, and cover-ups**.

**Why it mattered:**

* Americans lost faith in their **government’s competence and honesty**.
* It marked a **generational break**: young Boomers rejected their parents’ patriotism and idealism.
* It seeded a cultural shift from **heroic collective missions** (like WWII or the space race) to **skepticism, irony, and protest**.

---

### 🎯 Combined Effect:

Together, these crises made Americans **more cynical, risk-averse, and inward-looking**. The idea of charging into the future with bold, concrete plans—like nuclear-powered cities or moon bases—began to seem foolish or naïve.

This created fertile ground for the **indefinite optimism** Thiel criticizes:

> *“The future will be better, I guess... but don’t ask me how or why.”*

Let me know if you want a visual timeline or how this shaped Gen X attitudes too.

(but was most of the innovation before this in america?)

Great question. You're asking: **Before the 1970s slowdown, was most innovation happening in America?**
The short answer: **Yes, especially after World War II.** But let’s zoom out and give it context.

---

## 🔍 A Global Timeline of Innovation

### 🌍 **Before 1800** – Europe Dominates

* Major innovations (printing press, telescope, steam engine) came mostly from **Europe**—especially **Britain**, **France**, **Germany**, and **Italy**.
* America was still a colony, then a young republic. Its innovations were minor globally, though individuals like **Benjamin Franklin** were influential.

---

### 💥 **1800–1945** – UK → Germany → America Rises

* The **Industrial Revolution** began in **Britain**, with big breakthroughs in energy (steam), textiles, and transportation.
* In the late 1800s, **Germany** surged in **chemistry**, **engineering**, and **physics** (Einstein, Haber, etc.).
* **The U.S. began catching up rapidly**:

  * Inventions like the **telegraph**, **light bulb**, **airplane**, **assembly line**, and **steel production**.
  * The rise of industrial giants: **Edison**, **Ford**, **Bell**, **Carnegie**, and **Rockefeller**.
  * By **World War I**, America was an industrial superpower.

### 🦅 **1945–1970** – America Becomes the Global Innovation Engine

This was the golden age of **definite optimism**. Nearly all **frontier innovation** came from or was commercialized in the U.S.

#### Key reasons:

* **Brain drain**: Scientists fleeing WWII Europe came to America (e.g., Einstein, von Neumann, Fermi).
* **WWII investment**: The U.S. invested massively in R\&D: **radar, rockets, nuclear weapons, computers**.
* Postwar U.S. was **untouched by destruction**—unlike Europe and Japan—so it had resources to lead innovation.

#### Major U.S. innovations:

* **Atomic energy**
* **Semiconductors and transistors**
* **Mainframe computers**
* **Satellites and spaceflight**
* **The Internet (ARPANET)**
* **Polio vaccine**
* **Mass production & consumer tech**

#### Institutions:

* **Bell Labs**, **NASA**, **DARPA**, **MIT**, **Stanford**, and major corporations were all doing foundational R\&D.
* The **government funded basic science** and handed off commercialization to private industry.

### 💔 Post-1970: Innovation Slows, Globalizes, and Becomes Less Tangible

* As noted, the **1970s crises** caused a retreat from moonshot thinking.
* **Japan** and **South Korea** began leading in **consumer electronics, cars**, and later semiconductors.
* **Europe** continued strong in **aerospace**, **biotech**, and **green energy**.
* **China** emerged later (\~2000s) as a key innovator (especially in hardware, AI implementation, and infrastructure).

Meanwhile, U.S. innovation moved toward:

* **Software**, **finance**, **media**, and **platforms** (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon).
* More **incremental** than transformative—Thiel would say: “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.”

### ✅ So was most innovation pre-1970 American?

Yes—**from 1945 to 1970, America was by far the global leader** in innovation across most domains: energy, computing, aerospace, medicine, manufacturing.

But before that, **Europe led**. And after that, **innovation became more diffuse**, both geographically and in nature (less industrial, more digital).

Want to see this in a timeline or compare U.S. vs. Soviet innovation during the Cold War?

America used to believe in the Frontier Myth, then the Moonshot Myth.

Core idea: When government and science join forces with bold ambition, nothing is impossible — we can put a man on the Moon.






While germs were discovered in 16th century, the microscope was created to allow for that before. Technology builds on other technology.

Tech doesn't improve our lives in the same basic way. (but maybe focuses on information processing instad?-comparison to energy)







Looking back at how the world was changing before, now it seems mainly focused on

Boomers (born ~1946–1964) grew up during a time of uninterrupted prosperity, mostly because of postwar reconstruction, American hegemony, and cheap energy.

Life kept getting better by default, not through personal effort.

Many assumed this automatic progress would continue, and that you didn’t need a plan, just a good resume and a prestigious degree.

When inequality rose in the 1980s–2000s, elite Boomers benefited most—reinforcing their belief that the system "works."

📈 4. Careerism and Risk Aversion
High-achievers started optimizing for optional paths instead of bold bets: consulting, law, finance, tech product management.
