# Distributions that people don't intuitively understand

(People are really bad at recognising certain types of distributions)

People are bad at recognising certain types of distributions and realising they don't know about them. Humans are not rational creatures.

You can't keep track of more than 7 objects at the same time. You can't visualise a number bigger than 100,000 (0.0001% of the wealth of Elon Musk). You have certain cognitive biases such as the halo effect and similarity biases. These are the popular ones. In this article, I'll explore a few more with the help of some articles.



## Exponential distributions and compounding growth

I think this is one of the biggest ones that people don't understand intuitively, because very quickly the scales become incomprendible. If you doubled your money every day for a year, you would have more dollars than atoms in the universe.

This comes down to a practical level on how you live your life too though. Essentially, it means that it is better to change in smaller amounts more frequently than in larger amounts less frequently. For example, if I get 10% better every year or 1% better every month...

This applies very well to business. Also there have been studies on this (pot making thing), and I believe this is related. You can't learn everything by studying theory, you have to create, fail and iterate.

On a more concrete level, for persoal investing, this is why you should invest in something. Inflation means your money loses value over time exponentially. Investing can make it increase over time exponentially.

## Really big numbers

If people understood how rich Elon Musk was, I think a lot more people would be upset. The difference between a million and a billion doesn't sound like much, but the difference is orders of magnitudes. Use the time example
(This is a good visualisation-link to the Musk page)
(also a trend on social media)

## Really small numbers

risk of pandemic or nuclear war (very small probability but high consequences)-people like bill gates saw this coming


## False discretization

If you read about cognitive behavioural therapy, one of the biggest exagerations people make are black and white thinking and exaggeration. This thinking makes things more simple for our brain because often we think in concept, quanta of meaning.

## Non-linear/long-tailed distributions

These are one of the biggest unintuitive disttributions. If you study maths or engineering, a large part of your undergraduate education will be studying linear systems. Then one of the first t

also wealth?? agent based simulation

Skill is also non-linear
being able to run for a long distance is way more fun, or to do a pull up, but failing at running 100m at a time or doing mini pullups is less fun


## Long tailed distributions

A majority of the views come from 10% of the youtubers.

podcast post thing. most people quit after 5 episodes. tiktok culture becoming less permanent.

you think it will take you way longer to strike gold than it actually will. Eg gold mining in a river. And also a sparse distribution.


## Difficulty 

Personally, I find that my sense of difficulty is distorted from the amount of effort it actaully is. E.g. Ugh problems are exaggerated. Even if I'm feeling lazy walking to the store to get food often feels like it takes longer than it actually will, like 10 minutes instead of 3.

andrej karpathy a 10x more important problem is 10x harder  - not as true

## Knowledge distillation vs knowledge gain

40 year career, 4 year biography, 40 hours reading, 40 minute podcast.

It is way easier to learn than it is to create. One of the most basic is writing a book or a blog post takes way more time than reading it.

But also any entertainment, e.g. TV and theatre. And other types of knowledge like a podcast

4 second tiktok.

## Other interesting distributions

- Happiness over income
- Tradeoffs (often we think of them as two dimensional but that's incorrect)
- The St Peterberg paradox (This ties into some interesting ideas in decision theory - for more info I would recommend Simon DeDeo's baysesian reasoning paper)
    the st peterber's game (see Simon DeDeo on bayesian reasoning for intelligent people + Rosen textbook)
also the parado where you can calculate EV what should you do 
in rosen textbook talking about pascals wager/decision theory

- Skinner boxes (This is the reason that lootboxes exist. People don't get the most hooked when they have certain reward for certain effort-also can link to BK). social media too
- Investment advice. You don't just want maximum returns - you want maximum risk adjusted returns. In practice, when making any decision maximise your potential upside while minimising your potential downside. (calculated risks)
- From the beginning of geek heresy (ability is evenly distributed but opportunity is not)
- Network effect (a business that gets more valuable and harder to compete with as more people are added to the network)
- Wikpedia self similar network (maybe look at data science youtubers)
- amount of books sold? maybe power law

Other stuff I want to add in depth
- Income distribution by percentile and wealth income by percentile (before and after taxes) - power law or exponential. income vs wealth inequality (UK)
- Food distribution?? (The Ian Morris thing of how food equality actually got better in World War 2 in the UK)
    food distribution in the world - from a utlity POV it should be equal, but because of economics it's not ig

and compounding - investing
It sucks being at the bottom of the exponential curve (beginner phase)
whhat I  learnt after X business podcasts-sucks to be at the bottom of the curve
people give up when it sucks to be at the bottom of the curve, but some skills are multiplicative

do the example I have of 10% better every month or 3% better every week

maximise upside while minimising downside
investing
invest in yourself
exponentials, investing

- superstar effect

i mean just like how countries put regulations in place with gambling, the solution is for roblox to control how games make money. History has proven with games that basing it on some gambling makes the game endlessly replayable as chances are you have to do everything you did before to get another pull. So then devs just test how rare something should be so as to balance against a large group of people sticking around and grinding vs being outrageously expensive that no one will play.
given that roblox promotes games off of concurrency and sales — you can see how random chance prizes is the best game mechanic for incentivizing concurrency because it makes f2p players continuously grind. Separately for paying players they continue to spend more than the flat direct price of an item and instead the obfuscated cost of actually being lucky enough to earn the role within X pulls.
therefore nothing will change until roblox determines games need to do something to curb gacha prizes and their cost. This was attempted for non roblox games by listing their loot table and chances which organically discourage doing the bad practice of making things impossible to earn since you’d have to admit that it’s impossible to earn that. however it is still psychologically addictive for people who don’t understand statistics.
Typically though people with logic will understsand with clear math that if something on average only is granted every 100 pulls… then you are expected to pay 100x the cost to do a gacha pull. That expensive cost will be a significant factor in encouraging people to only do gacha pulls purely for fun.
Hence why also lottery tickets in america clearly state chances to win. gambling is a money printer for people
