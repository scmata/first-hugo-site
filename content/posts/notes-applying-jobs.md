things to add to CV


- cross functional collaboration, more clienty stuff for the tech consultant roles



the average resume has about 20 bullet points - you don't have space for everything, even though you've done more than you can describe in the bullets

CV

Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z] 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0

 "Developed investment case", "Solved client's concern", "Identified commercial risk".


 ighly targeted: Apart from his professional consultant experience, notice that two of Henry’s internship experiences are not directly related to management consulting. But they earn their spots in his resume because he’s able to highlight the aspects of these experiences that are relevant to consulting, i.e. client relationship management, project management methodologies and tools, and collaboration. They also show that he’s suitable for a range of different industries such as manufacturing, insurance, and finance.

 i like how preplounge highlighted stuff

types of CV
- ML engineer, data analyst/scientist, data-driven/tech consultant

- make a good CV



palantir SWE/ forward depolyed SWEs
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.



the forage for data analysis experince would be good too, but it seems like there are slightly less jobs im applying to in that area that are strict data analysis

more on the ML engineer side cus of my prior experience


[understand the tech stack of the company e.g. why amazon uses dynamodb over sql database](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9w7JX0KVErA)


resources (oxford website, SWErikCodes resume template/ google youtube videos of people applying for jobs/headless headhunter)


Applying to jobs out of college and when switching industries are the most difficult times to apply for job

1/25 interview rate is grade A resume for normal jobs, if below 1/100 something is wrong

Resume is to check you meet the basic requirements for the job, and to sum up your past experience fully.

Recruiters should not have to piece together/search to find how what you're doing is relevant. If they do, your work experience is not related enough.

Used

Steve Jobs quote

think about how much leadership capability they want you to show. in general, you need a foundation of technical capability to be able to lead. but steve jobs quote about leading yourself/employees leading themselves, the most basic jobs wont screen for that at CV stage/ it won't carry you. You need to show you meet the BASIC requirements

graduate jobs are different, you can show off potential a bit more

machine learning is interesting 

research interests

Physics historically used mathematics as a lens — describing the world through equations derived from first principles.
Machine learning, by contrast, offers a new kind of lens — describing the world through statistical or data-driven models that capture patterns directly from experience rather than deductive reasoning.

So, where math-based physics sought truth through axioms and derivations, ML-based science seeks structure through inference and prediction.

these kinds of models work in tandem with rule based models to increase our understanding of the world - particularly becuase many phenomena cannot easily be broken down into clockwork rules - instead there are patterns that can be observed at different levels of abstraction. and by improving our model we can improve our theories at each level of abstraction

language is an interface for cognition

some social theories e.g. principles of influence, pyschology could mainly be described experimentally or through "intuition" but now ML and language offer a new lens into these things


physics before was about using mathematics as a lens into the world, now machine learning allows almost a paradigm shift lens into the world by describing phenomena in terms of statistical models

- using language as a lens into new domains of science (particularly ones where theories exist but haven't been put into programmatic models) e.g. cognitive science, complexity theory, economics, game theory, information theory

“Language as a bridge from human intuition to formal scientific models.”

“Building computational mirrors of science through language.”

#### we create rigid world that is meant to evolve

rooms you cannot enter unless you pay a fee

e.g. programming too, is not natural to people because the brain si not built for structuring thing in terms of deductive logic 

technical debt and stuff

even words and language, we try to codify it

that's why contextual language models are so much more powerful than static embeddings

other: Streamlit, Slurm, Linux, (CLI?)

other other: agile/waterfall, software dev methodologies, test-driven development

other buzzwords: **client**, stakeholders, cross-functional collaboration

other project idea: do some analysis of YT videos, e.g. power law of views, connectedness of network

how different are real life networks to social media networks?
social media networks give culture out, so we produce less of it. more top down

that thing about wikipedia is like a self similar network
