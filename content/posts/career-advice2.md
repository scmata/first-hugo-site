The framework for figuring out what to do with your life.

In general, deciding on your job and finding a good one is probbaly one of the biggest impact things you can do. Also finding what life you want to make outside of work, since that is what you want to come back to.


- figure out how the world works. The "game" you are playing e.g. capitlaism.     - this works on different scales which interact. 
    -another person (experience, get good at being social). Pyschology and cognitive science. game theory? Build empathy and learn how to support long term, deep relationships. Many people struggle for this. This is the think that will help you feel lonely or not.
    -small communities and friend groups (figuring out friend group dynamics, having 3 is a good baseline because you're not to dependent on one). Know not to listen to the herd.
    -bigger communities e.g. schools and companies (how to stand out, how to communicate well in a large team). Finance
        - specific industries e.g. tech, healthcare
    -countries (politics and economics).
    -the world. Geopolitics. Big history

    Entrepreneurship will help this.
    At the end of the day you most likely live in a capitalist country, any way you earn money will be position around some way of providing value to other people. Be that making their lives more efficient, solving an annoying problem they face regularly

The world is imperfect. -macroeconomic thing -> people and systems are motiavated by incentives. Find yours and set them.
e.g. schools teach you to follow instructions rather than think.
(economics made me feel like I could see the matrix a bit lol)

If you want to learn how to prepare yourself think how the wealthiest parents educate their children. Use your own mental model though e.g. sending kids to activities all the time might not be good

understand biases? and the world is unfair

- each area will have some level of research. Use this to speed up. (Read the best books first)
- go to the best places to learn/learn from the best people (ben francis knowledge gaining curve)
= a lot of this is mainly gained by experience/is tacit knowledge (less tacit in America). 
-  lot of it is gained through empriical evidence/experience.  Some are able to be turned into mental models.

How to take advantages of gaps in the market. E.g. Success is not linear to effort. Once you've reached a certain point, it gets easier to get opportunities. (Experience needs experience)
most successful people come with a predisposition to getting into a field early or suceeding in it early, and then they have the first mover effect and superstar effect. Or you move second or third but do it better than other people.

e.g. pokimane

- figure out how to be happy/yourself
    - figure out your needs (e.g. shelter, food, friends, family, love/relationships,meaning)
    - figure out your incentives.
        - focus on meeting your basic needs. Then your motivation will likely come from power or improving the world.
        - realise that your work is not your source of happiness, but it can provide for it
    - figure out what you like doing. Typically if you find something you can do 99% better than other people, you can use that to be successful or pivot into other opportunities.
        - follow what you're interested in. easier to be able to do good work and get to forefront of the field, don't worry if not easy at first, it sucks being at the bottom of the distribution. use reward signals.
    - figure out what you like to do for fun (doing stuff, not just watching TV)


separation between thoughts and feelings


#### how to be wealthy
Getting really good at your niche(s). And building general skills.
Two stages, where you need to earn money to be happier and when you don't. Some skills overlap others don't. In general, building a high value skill will give you the opporunity to earn a high salary and invest it if you are smart. If you want wealth the real change will come from building things you own. The same generally goes for impact.

People from minority background know less about consulting, but it teaches you way more about owning stuff rather than earning a salary. The first is really important for true wealth.

(Mentality over all of this. Expoitation vs epxloration. Explotation is useful because it gets you to the level of having influence and actually being able to decide what you want to do.)

(Using that knowledge you can figure out how best to chase your personal incentives given the structure of society. By figuring out yourself it won't necessarily help you, cus you have to interact with your environment to produce anything and also to get a lot of your higher level needs.)

(learn the power of niche? most idea sit within a niche but also within an ecoysystem/market. like communication, or science communication has many layers.)

### advice for developing yourself

#### learn how to multiply your efforts
1. figure out what to spend time and energy on (orientation)
- -orient yourself and compound yourself. In any given moment, doing this continuously will have the largest gain over your whole life.
(choosing the right problems to solve and learning every day/building on yourself-society encourages a short term view of maximum  5 years, but if you can figure out ways to compound yourself to be ahead of the curve in 10/20 years time thenn you can set yourslef up for a lot of success with slightly less reliance on luck sometimes, since your ability to take advantage of opportunities right now is a bit fixed)
2. invest in skills and assets that compound (compound)
-to do this learn about emerging markets and join them early and develop a specalist knowledge. Most obvious is with technology. Countries is another one. If china is the biggest economy in 20 years-it pays a lot more to learn chinese now. I'm impressed that a few of my friends peers have this insight. Often parents help with the second part a lot. (There's a lot of opportunity because the world is change d alot right now, 30 years ago 80% of jobs didn't exist. And this trend will likely speed up not slow down. This also means that it is more dfficult to get advice from your direct elders so building the skill of being aware of change is important)

3. learn how to learn (from concrete sources like courses, as well as learning how to filter advice)

(orientating yourself in the right direction and compounding yourself are the two most powerful things you can do)

### mindset to have
1. be a magician
-Quite often, be a magician. You might be worried you can't figure out everything straight away. That's okay you have to be at the bottom of the curve at some point. Having the right north star in the back of your mind will help guide you.
2. think for yourself
- i dont typically do something/commit to something unless i can belive it with my own conceptual/generative model of the world instead of following what advice or most people tell me. typically tho, somettimes my model si incorrect or doesnt have enough info. in that case i seek more info by exploration with actions myself or asking someone, o rjust choose a random action (which includes no action) in the scheme of forced choice
3. learn to produce not ingest.
    A balance is needed. Art and inventions are not produced in a bubble. However, you want to be more on the production side not the ingestion side)

people don't care about the idea, they care about how much you know about the niche

some skills pay dividens: leadership, communication, how to work in a team, being social
