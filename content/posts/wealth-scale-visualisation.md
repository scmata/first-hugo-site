In addition to his donations, Gates co-founded The Giving Pledge in 2010 with Warren Buffett, encouraging billionaires to commit at least half of their wealth to charitable causes. Gates has pledged to donate 99.96% of his wealth during his lifetime, aiming to leave a modest portion to his children.

Despite these substantial donations, Gates' net worth remains significant due to investments and the appreciation of his holdings. As of mid-2025, his estimated net worth is $124 billion, reflecting both his philanthropic efforts and the growth of his investments.
