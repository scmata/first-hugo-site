My name is Sean Chidozie Mata. I am a student in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. 

What I am interested in learning about right now: start ups, career prospects in industry and academia, engineering

Currently reading: Man's Search For Meaning

## Goals:
* Creating a sustainable, **happier and more equal** society
* Creating a strong, stable **community** around me that lifts each other up
* Finding a **career** where I can work on projects I find **interesting intellectually**
* Use and develop my **leadership** skills to help reach my goals
* Live each day **mindfully**

## The idea of this website:
* To **"show my work"** or sell myself
* **Inspire a culture** of "showing your work" in Oxford
* Act as a point of **outreach and inspiration** to show how people like me can be successful

<!--
Inspire people to build more successful lives

## I have a wide range of skills. Here are some highlights:
* **Leadership**: I have led a **sports team** in my college in Oxford and competition teams in my secondary school
* **Independent thinking**: From a young age I have been motivated to lead **my own path**. This has led me down many rabbit holes.
* **Public speaking**: I have **chaired lectures, led Q&As and held technical presentations.** I enjoy the opportunity to present.
* **Problem solving**: I have worked on a **variety of projects** and I enjoy working on **intellectually stimulating** material (and also find repetitive/simple tasks sometimes mundane!)
* **Empathy**: I connect well with other people. It is underrated how far being a **good listener** and a centred, well-mannered person will get you. Being from a **very diverse background** and having many personal interests also helps.
* **Time management**: I juggle *a lot* of things in my life. Especially in Oxford, **I am very busy**. I have learnt to create **systems** to sustain this

## My background:

I was born in Dublin, Ireland to a Russian mother and Nigerian father (or as I call them: Mama and Papa). I moved to the UK when I was 10 years old, where I attended a local grammar school in Stratford upon Avon. I now study Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. 

Fun fact: I actually got offers from Imperial, Durham, Lancaster and Bristol for theoretical physics. This is why I say I wouldn't have done an engineering degree that wasn't from Oxford. Hence the "Science" in "Engineering Science" is quite important in my enjoyment of the degree. For me, intellectually I enjoy going between the theoretical and practical, however I don't like going into ideas that are too practical for my liking (because this uses less of my ability to imagine and conceptualise, and more of my ability to memorise-this links to the fact I get bored easily when I feel I've learnt something). The exception is when I am learning things to directly apply in real time, then it feels more like problem solving. Although my decision between studying physics and engineering was a difficult one, my current path has led to many opportunities and new interests which I am grateful for. 

In my first two years, I have studied the fundamentals of all major disciplines of engineering, mechanical, electrical, electronic, civil, computer, chemical etc. Next year, I will specalise mainly in control and information engineering. I think this is one of the degrees most suited to me, although sometimes I do wish my lecture notes went in a bit more detail sometimes...(not like there is space-the course is bloated anyway!)

I find the difference in perspectives to problem solving and life between engineers and physicists quite interesting. I think I'd like to be able to do both sides of the equation. (Alongside other things.)

## Random Interests:
Martial arts, engineering, maths, physics and science, sports, dancing, programming, travel, languages, reading, tinkering/electronics etc, good food, outreach and diversity
