My name is Sean Chidozie Mata. I am about to graduate with a degree in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. 

- I love learning. 
- I love meeting new people and understanding different perspectives.
- I love problem solving.

So far, these traits have helped me explore many skills from improvised comedy to Judo. It has also helped me explore many countries, including Spain, the UK and the USA. I'm eager to find out where I'll go next.

Career wise I'm most interested in:
- Data science
- ML/AI research
- Computational neuroscience

## My background:

I was born in Dublin, Ireland to a Russian mother and Nigerian father (or as I call them: Mama and Papa). I moved to the UK when I was 10 years old, where I attended a local grammar school in Stratford upon Avon. I now study Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. 

Fun fact: I actually got offers from Imperial, Durham, Lancaster and Bristol for theoretical physics. This is why I say I wouldn't have done an engineering degree that wasn't from Oxford. Hence the "Science" in "Engineering Science" is quite important in my enjoyment of the degree. For me, intellectually I enjoy going between the theoretical and practical, however I don't like going into ideas that are too practical for my liking (because this uses less of my ability to imagine and conceptualise, and more of my ability to memorise-this links to the fact I get bored easily when I feel I've learnt something). The exception is when I am learning things to directly apply in real time, then it feels more like problem solving. Although my decision between studying physics and engineering was a difficult one, my current path has led to many opportunities and new interests which I am grateful for. 

In my first two years of university, I studied the fundamentals of all major disciplines of engineering, mechanical, electrical, electronic, civil, computer, chemical etc. After that, I specalised in biomedical, electrical and information engineering. My thesis in Princeton University was a mix between computer science/cognitive science/neuroscience. (As you can tell, I pick stuff up quickly).

## Random Interests:
Martial arts, engineering, maths, physics and science, sports, dancing, programming, travel, languages, reading, tinkering/electronics etc, good food, outreach and diversity
