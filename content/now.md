### Finally spending some time at home; figuring things out
I just graduated from the University of Oxford! It was a very fun day.

I'm currently staying at home and figuring stuff out for the next year before I start full time work in 2026. I'm going to be staying at home mostly, and travelling to Oxford and London for friends, events and fun. This spring I'll set off on my world tour.

Last year I spent 9 months in Princeton University as an exchange student. This summer I spent 3 months working in Changzhou, China, which was really fun and eye-opening, but also quite intense.

A few things I'm working on:
- Getting my driving license
- Finding my general direction for the next few days (to do a PhD??) (and also reflecting on my mentality for life)
- Learning how to lip read (to help with my parially lost hearing)
- Building up my sources of income (and soon building in public hopefully)
- Writing more
